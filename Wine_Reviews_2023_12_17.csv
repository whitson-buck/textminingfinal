2019 Intrinsic Cabernet Sauvignon,We have to go all the way back to December of 2016 to find our last review of this win. although we’ve seen it multiple times at Costco since then and tasted it quite a few more times too. We must have overlooked how long it had been since we posted about it.And it’s a shame because it is a delicious win. year after yea. that readers should definitely explore. Costco’s price has actually come down over the year. hitting $15.99 today from $19.99 where it was a few years bac. which is closer to the retail price. It’s also a perfect case in point why we love Washington State wine so much. In the glas. the wine is a deep ruby with a vibrant nose of juicy cherry and spice. The wine is full bodied with flavors of cherr. boysenberr. raspberry; nice depth with mocha notes towards the nic. lingering finish. A beauty once again in this new vintag. and a very competitive Costco price.Go get ‘em. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 Points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 107520.

2019 Kirkland Signature Chianti Classico Gran Selezione,Here’s an exciting new addition to the Kirkland wine famil. and we were pumped when readers told us this one had started to appear in their store. and we were finally able to find it near us. This is a Chianti Classico Gran Selezion. which is the top of classification scale for Chiant. above Riserva. The designation means this wine is made from the estate’s top grapes and aged for 30 months compared to 12 months for Chianti Classico and 24 months for Chianti Classico Riserva. Costco’s price is right on at $17.99.  Most other bottles with this same designation are $35 and up. This is some amazing juice for under $2. making this bottle a very welcome addition to Kirkland’s wines. Let’s get into it. The wine is a deep ruby in the glass with nice earthy aromas and dried dark fruit.  In the mouth are flavors of blackberr. blueberry and plum that really come together beautifully; light mouthfeel; has a little of that cigar box and black pepper into the perfect finis. fresh acidity and nice depth. A beauty. The wine is produced by Basilica Caffaggio who has distributed some of their other entry level wines in Costco in the past.  In clicking around to research their other Gran Selezione wine. the prices are at least double what this bottle is selling for at Costco. We had high hopes for this win. and we’re happy to report that it lives up to them.  This is a great bottle to have around for the holidays.  Pair it with any foo. and anyone.  We hope Costco continues to bring in future vintages of this exciting new wine.  Cheers. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 93 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 171409.

2021 Il Poggione Rosso di Montalcino,This was an instant drop in the cart for us. Just the kind of wine we want to see land in Costco. First of. Rosso di Montalcino is what you want to see for a ridiculous quality to price rati. and that’s what happened here.

These wines are known as “baby Brunellos” since they come from the same are. same grape (Sangiovese. but just typically the younger vines on the property.  Kind of like a second wine from a Bordeaux estate.

2020 Kirkland Signature Saint-Julien Bordeaux,This was a surprise and delight.  The inaugural 2019 vintage of this new Kirkland offering was in stores in January of this yea. so we weren’t on the lookout for the next one quite yet. But what a nice surpris. along with the price going dow. albeit only a few cent. but we like it not moving the other direction. For $17.99 this remains a steal.  There is just no other way to get juice from this famed area of Bordeaux any less. The blend this year is the exact same as the prior one: 76% Merlo. and 24% Cabernet Sauvignon.  As we noted in our previous revie. most first wines from the left bank of Bordeaux are Cab drive. but second wines can sometimes be Merlot dominate. like this one. Tasting notes are very similar to last year as wel. signature Bordeaux on the nos. earth. barnyard aromas; medium ruby in the glass with dark fruit flavo. blueberr. black cherry and plum; nice depth and structure. We’re going to bump our score up one point to 92 with this new vintage.  It is absolutely deliciou. and one of the best Kirkland wine buys you’ll find..

2021 Kirkland Signature Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon,We were thrilled to see the 2021 vintage of this bottle hit stores.  As far as we can tel. there was not a 2020 vintag. likely due to the Napa fires.  So our fingers were crossed that a 2021 vintage would arriv. and here it is. Among the Kirkland wines from Nap. this ranks among our favorite. and this new vintage falls right in line.  The good news right away is the price staying the same at $18.99. Under $20 for Rutherford juice is almost unheard of; these will go fas. so if you’ve enjoyed this one in the pas. or are a fan of Rutherfor. grab these while you can.  Being a young wine to. you can sit on these for a while should you choose to. Over the years our reviews have been very good for this bottl. with a solid 92 points the past two. 201. 89 point. $17.9. 201. 92 point. $18.9. 201. 92 point. $18.9. Looking at this new 2021 vintag. we also have the same winemaker as years past.  The wine this time is right on par with the previous two strong vintage. and our tasting notes remain very similar. Dark ruby in the glas. with a nice combination of red and dark fruit throughout; black cherr. blueberr. plum; a touch more spice and mocha notes this time around; finishes with a hint of vanilla into the dusty finish these wines are known for.

2020 Chateau Fombrauge Saint Emilion Bordeaux,Here’s a new Saint Emilion Grand Cru that showed up at our Costc. and it’s one that we’ve tasted and always enjoyed in the past.  Usually a solid wine at a great valu. and that’s exactly what we found in the 2020 vintage. Costco’s price was $35.9. which is totally fair for a wine of this caliber.  Online it can found for a few dollars less which is surprising.  At Total Wine we saw the same bottle for $50.  We always hope that Costco’s price is the lowest aroun. but that might not be the case here. Huge scores on this win. across the board from the main critics.  94 points from Jeb Dunnuc. one of our favorites. 92 from Spectato. 90 from Wine Advocate. Long time readers know we are Bordeaux hound. and we usually gravitate towards the left bank bottle. but these Saint Emilions can be really enjoyable as we found here. The wine pours a pretty deep purple in the glass with a stink. barnyard nose; medium to full in body; nice rich fruit delivered elegantly; most dark fruit flavo. black cherrie. blackberr. boysenberry; earthy in the finish.

2019 Chateau Gloria Saint Julien Bordeaux,It was a surprise to see this Bordeaux land in Costco stores. As many of you know we are serious Bordeaux lover. and Chateau Gloria is consistently a winner in our books. The price at Costco is just what we wanted too: $34.99. It’s at least $45-50 almost everywhere els. even $54.97 at Total Wine. Costco’s price might be the best we’ve ever seen on this wine. Wine Spectator went a huge 94 points on this bottle. I know many readers are looking for Costco wine buys they can put away for a few year. and here’s a perfect on. at a super attractive price. We bought five bottle. and should have bought more. In poking around onlin. we found the blend: 65% Cabernet Sauvigno. 25% Merlo. 5% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot; what you expect from the left bank of Bordeaux. Right on the pou. the wine was a little tight and we knew it could benefit from a few more year. and certainly a decant. We’d recommend sitting on it for another five years. But with a little ai. we began to taste its true personality. This is a classic Bordeau. from a great region. Medium to full in body with nice black fruit flavo. tobacco notes; lon. dry and dusty finish. A very elegant Bordeaux even in its yout. this one will only improve with more bottle age. Get these while you can at this very attractive Costco price. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 92 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 166811. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. GA (Kennesaw.

2017 Vina Pomal Rioja Reserva,Just on the heels of tasting and reviewing this delicious 2017 Ribera del Duero we found at Costco for $12.9. we came across this very similar Rioja and had to give it a try. This Rioja is also a 2017 vintage and at Costco for $12.99.  It was fun to taste them in close vicinit. but it’d be even more fun to taste them side by side.  In the en. while we love both area. we’d probably give the Ribera a slight edge. But both of these wines are 90 points in our boo. and for the money are almost impossible to beat. This Rioja is a medium ruby in glass with earthy red fruit on the nose; flavors of black cherr. plu. mocha notes; tighter tannin. more acidit. nice touch of oak in the end. Made with organic grapes too. This wine tasted a little more youthful than the recently reviewed Ribera del Duero from the same vintage.   But agai. put either one up against 98% of other $13 bottle. and these would blow them away. Another nice find from Costc. and just the types of wines we love to find for this site: delicious wines at great Costco prices. Cheers. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick.

2017 Condado de Oriza Ribera del Duero Reserva,We had a good feeling about this bottl. and it lived up to it all the way.  A 2017 Ribera del Duero Reserva at Costco for $12.99.  Love it. Fans of Spanish wines like Riber. Toro or Rioja shouldn’t wait a second to scoop some of these u. especially at this price.  We feel this wine drinks 2-3X its meager price. 93 from Suckling is close this time around. The wine is a medium ruby in the glas. earthy nose; tannins are starting to softe. the wine feels great in the mouth; medium bod. elegant all around; flavors of black cherr. plum with notes of dark chocolate; smok. earthy and dry in the finish.

2021 Kirkland Signature Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon,We were really happy to see this bottle land in Costco stores this week.And instantly had to note the 2021 vintage. Turns ou. we never found the 2020 vintage which should have arrived in August of last year (2022).So the last time we saw this wine was in August of 2021 with the 2019 vintage.Glad that it wasn’t discontinued (an online search couldn’t turn up a photo from anywhere else of the 2020 vintage; it is mentioned on the placard below). And we noticed a rare price decreas. only $1 but it is down to $22.99 from the 2019 vintage’s $23.99 price tag.What a bargai. for a wine from one of our favorite areas of Napa where most Cabs start at $40-$50.

2021 DAOU Cabernet Sauvignon Paso Robles,It’s been a couple years since we last reviewed the DAOU Cabernet for this sit. but we’ve tasted several vintages since then as this is just a go-to bottle whenever you see it. Huge bang for the buc. and that was once again the case with this 2021 vintage at Costco for $20.99. That’s the lowest price we‘ve seen it at Costc. down from $22.99 a few years ago. Retail price is around $30 and it is online for $25 at a few outlets including Wine.com. We found quite a few 90+ point ratings on this vintage including rave reviews from Wine Advocate and Wine Enthusias. and we think they are right in line. This is actually a bit of a blend as we’ve noted in the past. The make up this year is 80% Cabernet Sauvigno. 11% Petit Verdo. 8% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc. Our tasting notes remain similar to past years and that’s a good thin. as this wine continues to represent the great quality at a fair price you can still find in Paso Robles.

In the glass it pours a medium ruby in color; good contrast of dark and red fruit; some black cherry and raspberry flavors; notes of dark chocolat. vanilla and cream towards the finish; pepper and spice linger in the finish.

There is just no other way to get juice from this famed area of Bordeaux any less. The blend this year is the exact same as the prior one: 76% Merlo. and 24% Cabernet Sauvignon.  As we noted in our previous revie. most first wines from the left bank of Bordeaux are Cab drive. but second wines can sometimes be Merlot dominate. like this one. Tasting notes are very similar to last year as wel. signature Bordeaux on the nos. earth. barnyard aromas; medium ruby in the glass with dark fruit flavo. blueberr. black cherry and plum; nice depth and structure. We’re going to bump our score up one point to 92 with this new vintage.  It is absolutely deliciou. and one of the best Kirkland wine buys you’ll find..

2021 Kirkland Signature Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon,We were thrilled to see the 2021 vintage of this bottle hit stores.  As far as we can tel. there was not a 2020 vintag. likely due to the Napa fires.  So our fingers were crossed that a 2021 vintage would arriv. and here it is. Among the Kirkland wines from Nap. this ranks among our favorite. and this new vintage falls right in line.  The good news right away is the price staying the same at $18.99. Under $20 for Rutherford juice is almost unheard of; these will go fas. so if you’ve enjoyed this one in the pas. or are a fan of Rutherfor. grab these while you can.  Being a young wine to. you can sit on these for a while should you choose to. Over the years our reviews have been very good for this bottl. with a solid 92 points the past two. 201. 89 point. $17.9. 201. 92 point. $18.9. 201. 92 point. $18.9. Looking at this new 2021 vintag. we also have the same winemaker as years past.  The wine this time is right on par with the previous two strong vintage. and our tasting notes remain very similar. Dark ruby in the glas. with a nice combination of red and dark fruit throughout; black cherr. blueberr. plum; a touch more spice and mocha notes this time around; finishes with a hint of vanilla into the dusty finish these wines are known for.

2020 Chateau Fombrauge Saint Emilion Bordeaux,Here’s a new Saint Emilion Grand Cru that showed up at our Costc. and it’s one that we’ve tasted and always enjoyed in the past.  Usually a solid wine at a great valu. and that’s exactly what we found in the 2020 vintage. Costco’s price was $35.9. which is totally fair for a wine of this caliber.  Online it can found for a few dollars less which is surprising.  At Total Wine we saw the same bottle for $50.  We always hope that Costco’s price is the lowest aroun. but that might not be the case here. Huge scores on this win. across the board from the main critics.  94 points from Jeb Dunnuc. one of our favorites. 92 from Spectato. 90 from Wine Advocate. Long time readers know we are Bordeaux hound. and we usually gravitate towards the left bank bottle. but these Saint Emilions can be really enjoyable as we found here. The wine pours a pretty deep purple in the glass with a stink. barnyard nose; medium to full in body; nice rich fruit delivered elegantly; most dark fruit flavo. black cherrie. blackberr. boysenberry; earthy in the finish. Right up our alley. We continue to receive requests from readers for Costco bottles that can ag. and here’s a good one to pop in the cellar.

2019 Chateau Gloria Saint Julien Bordeaux,It was a surprise to see this Bordeaux land in Costco stores. As many of you know we are serious Bordeaux lover. and Chateau Gloria is consistently a winner in our books. The price at Costco is just what we wanted too: $34.99. It’s at least $45-50 almost everywhere els. even $54.97 at Total Wine. Costco’s price might be the best we’ve ever seen on this wine. Wine Spectator went a huge 94 points on this bottle. I know many readers are looking for Costco wine buys they can put away for a few year. and here’s a perfect on. at a super attractive price. We bought five bottle. and should have bought more. In poking around onlin. we found the blend: 65% Cabernet Sauvigno. 25% Merlo. 5% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot; what you expect from the left bank of Bordeaux. Right on the pou. the wine was a little tight and we knew it could benefit from a few more year. and certainly a decant. We’d recommend sitting on it for another five years. But with a little ai. we began to taste its true personality. This is a classic Bordeau. from a great region. Medium to full in body with nice black fruit flavo. tobacco notes; lon. dry and dusty finish. A very elegant Bordeaux even in its yout. this one will only improve with more bottle age.

2017 Vina Pomal Rioja Reserva,Just on the heels of tasting and reviewing this delicious 2017 Ribera del Duero we found at Costco for $12.9. we came across this very similar Rioja and had to give it a try. This Rioja is also a 2017 vintage and at Costco for $12.99.  It was fun to taste them in close vicinit. but it’d be even more fun to taste them side by side.  In the en. while we love both area. we’d probably give the Ribera a slight edge. But both of these wines are 90 points in our boo. and for the money are almost impossible to beat. This Rioja is a medium ruby in glass with earthy red fruit on the nose; flavors of black cherr. plu. mocha notes; tighter tannin. more acidit. nice touch of oak in the end. Made with organic grapes too. This wine tasted a little more youthful than the recently reviewed Ribera del Duero from the same vintage.   But agai. put either one up against 98% of other $13 bottle. and these would blow them away.

2017 Condado de Oriza Ribera del Duero Reserva,We had a good feeling about this bottl. and it lived up to it all the way.  A 2017 Ribera del Duero Reserva at Costco for $12.99.  Love it. Fans of Spanish wines like Riber. Toro or Rioja shouldn’t wait a second to scoop some of these u. especially at this price.  We feel this wine drinks 2-3X its meager price. 93 from Suckling is close this time around. The wine is a medium ruby in the glas. earthy nose; tannins are starting to softe. the wine feels great in the mouth; medium bod. elegant all around; flavors of black cherr. plum with notes of dark chocolate; smok. earthy and dry in the finish.

2022 Invivo X by Sarah Jessica Parker Sauvignon Blanc,It’s been a little while since we’ve reviewed a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc from Costc. and this one popped up on our last visit and was a wine that we had always wanted to try. It’s a collaboration between Sarah Jessica Parker and New Zealand winery Invivo. There is also a French Rose as part of the collaboration that we will need to keep an eye out for too.. You can see on the Costco placard above that the wine received 93 points from Wine Spectator.  Looking at previous vintages of this win. they too pulled down quite a few 90+ point scores. Price-wis. this is a bargain at Costco for $13.79.  Online it’s $22 at Wine.com and we saw it at Total Wine for $20 right after we purchased it. .

2021 Kirkland Signature Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon,We were really happy to see this bottle land in Costco stores this week.And instantly had to note the 2021 vintage. Turns ou. we never found the 2020 vintage which should have arrived in August of last year (2022).So the last time we saw this wine was in August of 2021 with the 2019 vintage.Glad that it wasn’t discontinued (an online search couldn’t turn up a photo from anywhere else of the 2020 vintage; it is mentioned on the placard below). And we noticed a rare price decreas. only $1 but it is down to $22.99 from the 2019 vintage’s $23.99 price tag.What a bargai. for a wine from one of our favorite areas of Napa where most Cabs start at $40-$50. High scores for this bottle throughout the year. with the prior two vintages we tasted both hitting 91 points. And let’s call it a trifecta with the 2021. 201390 point. 201488 point. 201689 point. 201789 point. 201891 point. 2019 91 point.

2021 DAOU Cabernet Sauvignon Paso Robles,It’s been a couple years since we last reviewed the DAOU Cabernet for this sit. but we’ve tasted several vintages since then as this is just a go-to bottle whenever you see it. Huge bang for the buc. and that was once again the case with this 2021 vintage at Costco for $20.99. That’s the lowest price we‘ve seen it at Costc. down from $22.99 a few years ago. Retail price is around $30 and it is online for $25 at a few outlets including Wine.com. We found quite a few 90+ point ratings on this vintage including rave reviews from Wine Advocate and Wine Enthusias. and we think they are right in line. This is actually a bit of a blend as we’ve noted in the past. The make up this year is 80% Cabernet Sauvigno. 11% Petit Verdo. 8% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc. Our tasting notes remain similar to past years and that’s a good thin. as this wine continues to represent the great quality at a fair price you can still find in Paso Robles. The wine is a medium ruby in the glass; nice combination of red and dark frui. blueberr. cherry and plum with some mocha notes; medium to full bodied; spicy oak in the lon. lingering finish.

2020 Chateau de Vaudieu Chateauneuf-du-pape,We love finding and tasting new Chateauneuf-du-pape from Costc. and here’s a new addition to the wine aisles that turned out to be a huge score. Outside of the Kirkland Chateauneuf-du-pape that is priced at $2. it’s hard to find good Chateauneuf at a reasonable price.Usually you have to spend $40-$50+ to get the highly rated and super tasty ones. Costco’s price on this bottle was $30 and online it looks to be going for a little more than tha. around $34-$37. The Costco placard nicely displays the Wine Spectator 94-point ratin. and in clicking around online we found a 93 from Jeb Dunnuc. who is one of our favorites.The wine is mostly Grenache with smaller parts Syrah and Mourvedre. In the glass it pours a medium ruby in color; good contrast of dark and red fruit; some black cherry and raspberry flavors; notes of dark chocolat. vanilla and cream towards the finish; pepper and spice linger in the finish. This was a delicious Chateauneuf and one of the better ones we’ve had in the price point.Our rating is going to match Jeb’s at 93 points.This is a trea. an excellent buy and an easy addition to our Top Picks list.

Sometimes the white section can get a little stale with the same wine. at least around the stores we frequent. This is a dry Riesling from Alsac. coming in at a solid $14.99.  The wine looks to be around $18-$21 at other outlets we found. . Big scores for this one too including the 93 points noted on the placard from Wine Enthusiast. And we found a lot to like as well. The wine pours a medium straw color with vibrant citrus fruit and lemon on the nose.  In the mouth are flavors of aprico. orange and green apple; nice acidit. clean and crisp with a lasting finish. .

2019 Kirkland Signature Barolo,Finally…the new vintage of the Kirkland Barolo hits stores.  We typically see this bottle arrive in the first few months of the yea. so we’ve been on the look out. Something caught our eye right away and that is the vintag. 2019.  Last February we tasted and reviewed the 2017 vintage of this wine. So we really expected this to be the 2018 vintag. the obvious next vintage in line. But there seems to be no legitimate trace of a 2018 vintage being produced.  Online there are a few places with tasting notes on the mysterious vintag. but we didn’t see an actual picture of the bottle.  Everything shows 2017 or earlier. We also noted the pric. $19.99 staying the same since this bottle’s inaugural 2015 vintage. We love to see that obviously as this remains an incredibl. almost unheard o. price for a high caliber wine. Here are our ratings of the Kirkland Barolo so far.  Super hig. in fac. the highest average of any Kirkland wine. 2017 vintage: 93 point. 2016 vintage: 92 point. 2015 vintage: 92 point. Can the 2019 live up to the hype of year’s past?  It absolutely does. The wine pours a pale garnet in the glas. super big nose with aromas jumping out the glass; good mouthfee. medium body; earthy black cherr. blackberry flavor. with a nice does of acidity; strong finish.

2021 Kirkland Signature Chateauneuf du Pape,We were thrilled to find the new Kirkland Chateauneuf a full month earlier than in years past.  Rumblings began a few weeks ago among readers who had found i. and thankfully it hit our stores this past weekend. A few things to not. starting with the pric. staying steady at $19.99.  We would have almost bet anything this one was going up especially since it has crept up to $21.99 in previous vintages. At $2. this remains about the lowest price Chateauneuf you can find.  We love the fact that the Kirkland brand brings in these wines from premier regions at reasonable prices since normally they are priced 2X or 3X more than thi. making them less attractive to many wine buyers. Here’s a look back at of our historical ratings for the Kirkland Signature Chateauneuf du Pap. which is a favorite wine in the Kirkland portfolio. 2020 90 point. 201988 point. 201890 Point. 201690 Point. 201589 Point. 201488 Point. 201393 Point. 2012 91 Point. 2011 92 Point. 2010 91 Point. 2009 91 Point. The varietal breakdown remains the exact same for the past four vintages no. coming in at 70% Grenach. 10% Syra. 10% Mourvedre and 10% Cinsault. Our tasting notes are similar to the prior 2020 vintag. and the 2018 before that.  And our scores will reflect as much. Medium ruby in colo. nice expressive nose of eart. herbs and dark fruit; medium body with good acidity; flavors of dark frui. blackberr. plum and some dark chocolate; pepper and spice in the finish that lingers quite nicely. We remain big fans of this win. and it is a serious score at Costco for only $20.  We bought three bottles on our initial trip but would like to cellar a coupl. so might have to pick up more. This is one of the Kirkland offerings that can move pretty fast.

2021 Monte Degli Angeli Collezione del Barone Piemonte Pinot Noir,This bottle exemplifies why we love the wine journey.  Sometimes you just get smacked in the face with an unsuspecting bottle that captures the spirit of exploration. We didn’t remember how much this cost at the time we were drinking it.  It came from the cheap seats (the aisles of wine vs wooden boxes. just a inexpensive Italian Pinot Noir.  We threw it in the cart out of curiosity.  And so happy we did. This is a real deal Pinot Noi. and the fact that it can be scored for only $7.99 at Costco is nuts.  Even Suckling is right about this bottle. In the glass the wine is a medium ruby and once in the mout. you can feel it’s heft.  Definitely not a wimpy Pino. and very Italian in character.  It has a juicy red berry nos. medium plus in body with good acidity; flavors of raspberry and cherr. earthy with good depth.

That was said around our review of this fantastic wine that we gave a solid 90 points. And then the next wine we taste is this gem from Rioja.  This one is 100% Tempranillo vs the blend (40%) on the Portuguese wine.  While not super comparable it is interesting to note how different these expressions are. The 2018 Cartuxa EvoraColheita Tinto was a big win. loaded with flavor and body; ready to take on a late spring grill with burgers and ribs. This Rioja is the olde. elegan. chill side of the equation.  Ready for a fine meal. . And Costco’s price of only $11.99 is hard to believe considering Wine Library (our favorite online store) is showing a retail price of $35 and a sales price of $19.99. . And elegance is what this wine exudes.  Sure it has a little age built in which help. and it is just ready to drink right now with juicy red frui. silky smooth tannin. a medium bod. tasty finish.  Not one thing off with this bottle. It’s hard to believe Costco is selling something this good at such a low price. If you like Rioja don’t wait to stock up on this one.

2015 Bodegas Olarra Anares Gran Reserva Rioja,Bodegas Olarra puts quite a few different wines into Costco stores and they always turn out to be solid values. This Gran Reserva may be among the best of the best for only $15.9. which is about as low as you’ll find a Gran Reserva bottle. We found a retail price listed at $4. and Vivino was showing $22.So we’re looking at a nice Costco discount and a very low price for a wine like this. And there’s a 93 point rating from Wine Enthusias. which we feel is pretty right on. We love Rioj. especially the Gran Reservas that bring a little extra age already built in.This is a perfect example where a lot of the work has been done for you.You could let it run a little longe. but it’s also super enjoyable today. In the glass the wine is a pale rub. leaning toward garnet with light rust starting around edges. It is earth. pepper. with black cherry on the nose; medium body with soft tannins that have started to settle in. The wine is packed with flavors of black cherr. plum and raspberry; it is light and delicate in the finish that lingers for a bit. This is a delicious wine at a fantastic price.We’re huge fans and imagine you will be too.Buy a few of these if you see it. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 92 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick.

2020 Kirkland Signature Suscol Vineyard Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,We heard about a week and a half ago that this popular Kirkland wine was hitting shelve. and we didn’t see it on a prior trip the past weeken. but found it last night.. And it’s one you need to grab when you can.  It can disappear in days.  And with good reaso. because it’s historically been a delicious wine at a really good price. We’re happy to report the same story once again with the new 2020 vintage.  The price staying the same at $16.99 was a welcome sight.  We’re just waiting for this one to start creeping up. It’s the same label design and winemaker (Jeff McBride) as the previous two vintage of this bottle which debuted with the 2018 vintage back in April of 2021. For each of the past two vintage. we’ve rated them 91 points with a Top Picks designation.  You can read those here. 2018 vintag. 2019 vintag. The wine tastes similar to the past vintages as wel. especially after it gets a little airtime and opens up. . Deep ruby in the glass with a earthy cherry nose; vegetal notes with full body and good acidity; juicy red and dark fruit flavor; dark chocolat. dry and lasting in the finish.  As we’ve said befor. it’s not your average Napa Cab. . We’re stoked to see this back in stores at the same price and tasting as good as ever. If you’ve tasted and enjoyed this one befor. stock up if you see it.  If you’re just now learning about i. keep an eye out and don’t hesitate because this one moves fast. We’ll be keeping our rating the same at 91 point. and will add this bottle to ourTop Pickslist. This is a reason to shop at Costco. Cheers.

2021 Tabali Talinay Sauvignon Blanc,Chile isn’t always the first place you think of when looking for world class Sauvignon Blan. but it will be higher on our list after tasting this one. . Wo. this is a beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that caught us by surprise. The wine hails from the Limari Valley in Chil. located about 300 miles north of Santiago. . Costco’s price was $21.9. and online it looks like it sells in around that same rang. maybe a little higher. The Costco placard also shows off the 94 points the wine received from Vinou. and we found a 91 point review from Wine Enthusiast.  So we were anxious to give it a taste. In the glass the wine is a pale to medium yello. lemony on the nose; in the mouth is a nice dose of citrus frui. some pear and orange peel; nice minerality and acidity. Excellent finis. and just well done all around. This is a memorable win. a rather uniqu. flavor packed and interesting expression of the Chilean terroir.  We’re big fan. and we’ll be placing on our Top Picks list.  If you were ever bored with Sauvignon Blan. give this one a shot. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick.

2019 Charles Krug Cabernet Sauvignon Napa,We were on the hunt for Costco bottles we haven’t reviewed ye. and found this Napa Cab from Charles Krug that we’re pretty sure we’ve tasted befor. just haven’t posted about it. . Over the years of running this sit. we’ve reviewed three past vintages of the Charles Krug Sauvignon Blanc (202. 201. 2012) but not their Cabernet yet. We’ve always found the Sauvignon Blancs to be very good buys. Costco’s price on this Cabernet was $27.8. but a later online search showed it available at Total Wine for $26.9. and elsewhere online it was selling for mid $30’s.  So a good but not great price at Costco this time. This wine consistently pulls down ratings in the low 90’s from Wine Spectator and Wine Enthusiast.  It’s also a bit of a blend comprised of 92% Cabernet Sauvigno. 5% Petit Verdo.1% Merlo. 1% Cabernet Franc and 1% Malbec. In the glass the wine is a dark ruby with red berrie. pencil shavings and spice on the nose; good depth in the mouth with more red berry frui. along with black cherry and mocha notes; finishes chalky and spicy.. This one is pretty big and bol. but well executed and Napa wine fans will find a lot to like.  It definitely drinks above its pay grade and is a perfect example of the bump in quality you get when you move from the $10-$15 range to the $20-$30.

2018 Bodega Tapiz Bicentenario Red Blend,This was a great Costco wine find that was recommended by several readers. Bodega Tapiz is a super dependable producer from Argentina.It’s been a while since we’ve reviewed a wine from them (longer than I thought).The last review was back in 2019 with the Tapiz Black Tears Malbe. a big time winner and one that we’ve enjoyed a few more times since. We also reviewed their estate blend a while back and before that we tasted the ’14 vintage Malbec.All of these wines earned high marks from u. and we’re thrilled to see that continue with this Bicentenario Red Blend. The blend is interesting consisting of 60% Malbe. 30% Bonarda and 10% Torrontes. Costco is bringing this in for $21.99 which is a bargain.Online we see it hovering in the mid $30s at most outlets. And you can see Suckling is a fa. awarding 93 points on this 2018 vintage and 94 points on the 2015 vintage. I know we all feel he rates super hig. but just sharing…now getting into the wine. It pours a medium purple in the glass with cigar box and dark fruit on the nose; the wine is medium plus in body with spicy black cherry and blackberry flavors; notes of dark chocolat. earth and spice in the finish. A nice expression of the terroi. and a beautiful blending of these varietals. This wine really needed a decant so give it a little air before you jump in.It was a little tight right out of the bottl. but came together with 30 minutes or so in the decanter.This is definitely a winner at a solid Costco pric. and a wine that will earn a spot on our Top Picks list.

2020 Kirkland Signature Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon,We heard from readers that the latest vintage of the Kirkland Oakville Cab was hitting store. and we finally found it after multiple trips to Costco over the past couple of weeks. This is one of our favorite wines in the Kirkland portfoli. and it remains really hard to beat for under $20.  And that’s the price where this one lands again with the new 2020 vintage. That’s refreshing to see as often these $20 Kirkland bottles will jump up a few buck. and then down a couple years later.  This one just stays pretty consistent which is nice (it was $1 less a few vintages back). Historicall. this wine has delivered time and time again. Here are our ratings going back to the 2013 vintage.. 2019 91 point. 201891 point. 201790 point. 201690 point. 201591 point. 201390 point. 90+ points across the board.  91 the past few vintage. and this new vintag. while not quite up to the ’18 and ’19 level is very close and will keep the 90 point string going. It’s also worth noting that 2020 was an interesting growing year in Napa.  Wildfires affected some operation. while others were completely unaffecte. or had already harvested their fruit.  So yields overall were on the low side.. We’re not sure how that impacted the volume of this Kirkland offerin. but we can confirm that this wine seems have dodged any major issues. This wine is signature Nap. ready to drink right now. Beautiful nose of ripe black frui. bell pepper and cedar; full bodie. loaded with flavors of black cherr. blackberry and plum; a touch of vanilla into the finish. Really good juice and fun to drink.  Maybe just a hair below the previous few vintage. but still a wine that many of you who have enjoyed previous Oakville bottles will enjoy once again.

2021 Cristom Mt Jefferson Cuvee Pinot Noir,Here’s a new Willamette Valley Pinot Noir that showed up in Costco stores near us. It’s not an inexpensive bottl. coming in at $36.99 at Costc. which is about what you will find it for at other outlet. including Total Wine who carries it for $38.99. Retail appears to be in the low $40’s. This wine has an unbelievable critic scorecard (see below) over the year. first evidenced by the whopping 95 points for the 2019 vintage from Wine Advocate. A quick Google search turns up a whole list of 90+ points over the years. So let’s see what this one is all about. It pours a pale ruby in the glass with red fruit and earth on the nose; flavors of cherry and red berries; a little vanilla into the finish; soft in the mouth. Lots to like here. This is a class. delicat. gentle wine that’s not overbearing; Burgundian in approach for sur. and certainly a wine that that we can get around.

2016 Bodegas Valdelacierva Rioja Reserva,Finding this bottle was a pleasant sight for us in the Costco wine aisles.We have previously reviewed the 2014 vintage of this wine and really enjoyed it. You can see by the Costco placard this bottle has received a string of 90+ point rating. including 90 points from us on the 2014 vintage.2016 was a very good vintage in Rioja too so we had high hopes for this new one. As we noted befor. retail price seems to be around $3. so Costco’s price is amazing and it was nice to see it hold steady at $14.99. The wine starts with subtle dark fruit and spice on the nose; it is medium plus in bod. very elegant and smooth throughout; soft tannins with flavor of black cherr. dark berry fruit. Finishes nice with some vanilla notes and mild oak. We’re going to bump up our rating to 91 as this win. like so many from Spain right no. was very impressive and well made; and the $15 price point is a nice Costco bonus.

2010 Hidalgo Tradicion H Gran Reserva Rioja,This almost seemed to good to be tru. but a reader informed us this Gran Reserva Rioja from 2010 was hitting Costco stores.  And the price was only $14.99. We got lucky and found it on our next visit.  Back in 2018 we reviewed the 2012 standard Hidalgo Tradicion H Rioj. and really enjoyed it.  Now we get a Gran Reserva with a little more age on i. at the same price. The Gran Reserva designation means that the wine has spent 5 years being age. at least two years in oak and three in the bottle. This is such a bonus as all the work has been done for you; and now it’s ready to drink. Wine Enthusiast went 94 points on this win. and listed the retail price at $4. so Costco is really discounting this one.  You better move fast if this sounds like your jam because these might disappear from shelves rather quickly. On the pour and on the nose there are early signs of ag. a slight rusty rim starting to appear and you get a bit of that dusty library scent on the nose.  But a few swirls in the glass and this one comes alive in a big way. . Fruit is alive and vibrant; tons of black cherry and plu. spicy and earthy; good acidity and smooth tannins; touch of vanilla in the finish which is powerful and lingering. After 13 years this wine is in a very beautiful place right no. ready to enjoy as i. at a price that is flat out remarkable for what you get.

2019 Justin Cabernet Sauvignon Paso Robles,Today we’re tasting a new vintage of a consistent winne. the Justin Cabernet from Paso Robles. Not only are we huge fans of wines from Paso Robles because they just seem to always overdelive. we love this base level Justin as a go to winner under $20. . They also make a delicious Bordeaux blend called Justin Isosceles that we highly recommend.  That one will set you back about $8. but it also is worth every penny when you want something a little more special. Costco’s price on this Justin Cabernet isn’t really discounted at all.  You can find this bottle for $20 almost everywhere.  We are glad to see it staying at that $20 leve. because it drinks like a wine that could cost 2X that. As we taste this 2019 vintag. it is immediately very familiar to the 2017 vintage that we last reviewed back in May of 2020 (we also reviewed the 2016 vintage in 2018). This is a great wine once again. It is a dark ruby on the pour with dark fruit and spice on the nose; flavors of black cherr. blackberry and plum; good dept. herbal note. full in body and lasting in the finish. Just classic Paso Robles Cab. We’re going to keep our rating the same at 90 points and keep this wine on our recommended wine list. Still love this one.

2020 My Favorite Neighbor Cabernet Sauvignon,One of our favorite wines that we tasted last year is back at Costco with the latest vintag. and we were pumped to find it. We reviewed the 2019 vintage back in July and gave it a whopping (and well deserved) 95 points.  That rating also puts it towards the top of our annual Best of the Year list for 2022. Costco kept the price the same for the 2020 vintage at $45.99 which is awesome because it seems to be creeping up elsewhere as word gets out about how good this wine is for the money. It’s up to $55 at K&amp;L and they are usually among the most competitively priced shops online. The wine receives an unbelievable amount of praise from the wine critic. with scores lingering in the mid 90’s almost across the board.  And we wholeheartedly agre. because this wine delivers the goods. The wine is a bit different with each vintage as they source the grapes from various plots.  This time from vineyards in Paso Roble. San Luis Obispo and Edna Valley. And although it’s labeled as just a Caberne. the wine is actually a Bordeaux style blend of 86% Cabernet Sauvigno. 4% Syra. 4% Petite Sira. 4% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. Let’s get into it. The wine is a nice dark ruby on the pour; on the nose are big aromas of spice. tobacc. red fruit; a delicious combination of red and dark fruit flavors with layers of depth; medium plus to full bodied. Really well made. Bi. bold and fresh. This is just a delightful wine on so many levels.

2019 Kirkland Signature Saint-Julien Bordeaux,In all the years of running this sit. this might be the Costco bottle we’ve wanted to find the most.  We love the Costco hun. but when we first heard from readers this new Kirkland wine was out ther. we were hitting our Costco stores left and right trying to find it. Finall. we found it at the Cumberland location in Atlanta.  We’ve heard that Alpharetta and Cumming might have it too for you ATL locals. Long time readers will know that Bordeau. in particular the left ban. and in particular Saint-Julien is one of our favorite wine regions.  We had the privilege to visit a few years ag. and that just sealed the deal for us. So we couldn’t wait to taste this wine. . Of cours. we had to do some sleuthing to figure a few things ou. especially because this is the inaugural vintage. In trying to learn more about exactly where these grapes came fro. you’ll see on the back label (below) it lists Maison Gineste. which we looked up and learned they are a wine merchant in Bordeaux. Don’t know much about the. but looks like a fancy place. We pulled the cork wondering if it would reveal any more clues as they sometimes d. but it simply read “mis en bouteille dans nos chais” meaning the wine was “bottled in their cellars.”  This tells us the grapes were likely bought on the open market and then bottled in a different place than it was grown. So net-ne. not a whole lot of interesting inf. but for us Bordeaux fans it was worth poking around. Costco’s price on this bottle was $18.6. and like we say on many of these Kirkland bottlings from a premier regio. you just won’t find other bottles from these place. like Saint-Julie. for this cheap.  It really is amazing. One other thing to note is the varietal blen. which is 76% Merlot and 24% Cabernet Sauvignon.  Most left bank Bordeaux wines are Cab dominated so this is a little different.  But you do see more Merlot lead blends occasionall. often in an estate’s second bottle as is the case with Chateau Palme. a personal favorite. We actually found their “second” win. Alter Eg. at Costco and it was heavier Merlot than Cabernet. O. enough with the preambl. let’s get into the win. which we thought was very nice. The wine pours a medium to dark ruby in the glass with signature Bordeaux aromas of earthy dark fruit; it is medium plus in body with good acidit. tight tannins that will soften over time; nice black cherr. plu. dark fruit profil. with some mineral note. a little chocolate into the dry finish. This is a very nice Bordeaux at an extremely compelling price.  We’re glad we bought thre. and plan to drop one in the cellar for a few years for fun. This might be the most exciting new addition to the Kirkland line of wines since the Barolo or Gigondas.  There used to be a Kirkland Pauillac Bordeaux that was amazin. but that one unfortunately disappeared about ten years ago.  Here’s a welcome replacement.

2022 Costco Wine Thanksgiving Picks,Thanksgiving is one of our favorite holidays and it’s the perfect time to enjoy great food and great wine with friends and family.  Our favorite thing to do. And Costco is one of the best places to stock up on what you need for the big meal.  Here we like to talk about Costco win. so let’s take a look at some ideas we want to share on what wines you might want to consider. Our feelin. and we think this is starting to become the general consensu. is that several different types and styles of wine can work with a traditiona. or even non traditiona. Thanksgiving meal. Our approach is to get out multiple glasses per perso. and try a wide range of wines to see what each person likes best.  This can include re. whit. rose or bubbly.  Our tastes tend to lean towards lighter reds (like Pinot Noir. interesting whites and good Champagne which can go with about anything (food / people / environment). So let’s jump into some of our picks. We are trying to assemble this from wines we’ve seen in stores recently as well as ones that seem to have some staying powe. so hopefully you are able to find some of them near you. . And of cours. please share your favorites in the comments below.  Cheers. Sparkling Wines: perfect for befor. during or after the mea. Chandon Brut Ros. This is a fun one that’s widely available and a good buy at $16.  You can also go for their straight brut which is delicious as well our revie. Veuve Clicquot Brut Champagne Yellow Labe. Veuve is always a classy pick and it still remains a delicious Champagne.  $48.99 at Costco which isn’t really discounted from what you’ll find it elsewher. but we always find ourselves buying and enjoying a few of these a year our revie. Kirkland Signature Champagn. If you don’t want to pay the Veuve pric. and don’t mind showing your guests the Kirkland labe. for $20 the Kirkland Champagne is always a favorite and a super tasty bubbly for your table read our revie. White Win. 2021 Duckhorn Decoy Sauvignon Blan. This is a solid Sauvignon Blanc for the mone. and we’ve seen it in large quantities in stores near us.  We went 87 point. and it’s a wine we’d buy again.  Plus many of your guests may recognize the Duckhorn name our revie. 2021 Westmount Pinot Gri. Here’s another white we enjoyed recently and have confirmed is still in Costco stores around the Atlanta area.  91 points from Wine Enthusiast and only $12.79. Plus we love Oregon wines. Go Ducks our revie. 2021 Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars AVETA Sauvignon Blan. Ye. here’s one we just posted so it should still be in stores; it’s a delicious Sauvignon Blanc from a great producer at a nicely discounted Costco price our revie. Red Win. 2020 Boen Pinot Noi. This was a new Costco Pinot for u. and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The wine is a blend of grapes from three different California counties and it comes together perfectly.  Costco’s price is $18.99 our revie. 2018 Devois des Agneaux d’Aumelas Languedo. This was a big find for us that we think is still in stores; a tasty Languedoc red blend of 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache that is a steal for only $12.99 our revie. 2018 Mosquita Muerta Pispi Blend de Tinta. This was a highly rated red blend from Argentina that caught our attention.  The blend is Malbec (40%. Cabernet Franc (10%. Merlot (10%. Petit Verdot (20%) and Bonarda (20%).  Costco’s price is $14.99 and we think this is a solid red that can appeal to almost any red wine drinker our review. 2019 Four Graces Pinot Noir Willamette Valle. We’d be remiss not to sneak in one more of our favorite Pinots on this list.  This is some serious delicious juice for $20 that likely will make its way onto our table this Thanksgiving.  We just saw it in stores this week our revie. Rose Win. 2021 Kirkland Signature Cotes De Provence Ros. We had to include this one since we’ve actually seen it still in store. which is hard to believe.  Historicall. this wine has sold out in a handful of week. a month or so tops.  And the price has stayed under $10.  This is very good rose at a fantastic price our revie. There’s our list.  We had to keep it to wines that were reviewed pretty recentl. or ones that we know to be Costco staples so you will hopefully be able to find some of them.  We also tried to add a few picks that we haven’t used in prior lists. And remember to let us know any of your favorites in the comments below. Happy huntin. and happy Thanksgiving.. A.

2021 Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars AVETA Sauvignon Blanc,We love seeing new bottles from Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars hit the shelves at Costco and this AVETA Sauvignon Blanc is one that we’ve never seen befor. at least around the Atlanta area Costco stores we frequent. Previousl. as far as white wines go from Stag’s Leap Wine Cellar. we’ve reviewed and enjoyed their Karia Chardonnay and standard Sauvignon Blanc.  The wines have continually offered a good bang for the buck. So we were super curious to get into this one.  Costco’s $22.99 price tag is pretty goo. considering retail is around $30 and it looks to be selling a little higher than that even at some online outlets. There are a few 90+ point ratings called out on the Costco placard and we found a few more in our online searches on this wine.. We also noticed on the Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars website that this wine is actually a blend consisting of 76% Sauvignon Blan. 19% Sauvignon Musque (a clonal variant of Sauvignon Blanc. 4% Muscat Canelli and 1% Semillon. In the glas. the wine pours a medium yellow with citrus fruit on the nose; bright and crisp acidity; flavors of citru. grapefruit and green apple. Finish really lingers. This is a delicious wine. . Just what we hoped for from a favorite producer; we’re going to be adding this bottle to our recommended wine list. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick.

2017 Kirkland Signature Series Brunello di Montalcino,Here’s one of our favorite Kirkland wines coming in right on time with the latest vintage.  Fall is usually when this Brunello hits store. and right off the bat we have some good news with the price staying at $19.99. Long time readers may remember this wine had crept up to $27 in prior year. and then started coming back down.  We really like it right here at $2. which is an amazing price for any Brunell. even more so for a tasty on. as this bottle usually is. Looking back over our note. we’ve tasted every vintage of this Kirkland offerin. dating back to the awesome 2010 vintage.  Here’s a look at the scores over the years. 2010– 92-93 point. 2011– 86 point. 2012– 87 point. 2013– 88 point. 2014– 88 point. 2015– 89 point. 2016 – 91 point. Trending the right direction as we feel this bottle has finally stabilized close to 90 points after that dip almost a decade ago.  And that’s where this new 2017 vintage will land for us. The wine is a medium garnet in color with a lovely nose of red fruit and spice; it is medium plus in body with good acidity right off the bat; nice flavor profile with cherry and raspberry; clean finish.  Really tasty juice once again. We’re going to say this is just a small notch below the 201. and believe it or not we ran into some 2016 bottles just a few weeks ago and opened on. so it is super fresh in memory. This is still a favorite and a great buy.  We’re going to bring the rating down to 90 for the 2017 and recommend Brunello and Italian wine fans give it a shot.

We scooped this one up at a store in Jacksonvill. F. attracted largely by the $9 limited time discount that brought the price from $22.99 to $13.99.  It turned out to be a subtl. elegant Cabernet that we awarded 91 points our revie. 2019 Chento Malbe. This turned out to be our favorite Malbec find at Costco during 202. and we tasted a fair amount of them.  $14.69 price ta. and a ton of 90+ point reviews from the critics (91 from us. this is one to remember our revie. 2017 Kirkland Signature Barol. No surprise here from long time reader. this remains a Kirkland favorite and the 2017 vintage was no exception.  This bottle has hit this list three years in a row now.  The price stayed the same at $19.99 and we bumped our rating up to 93 points with this vintage our revie. 2019 Kirkland Signature Oakville Cabernet Sauvigno. Here’s another Kirkland winner that also hits this list most vintages.  Agai. price stayed consistent at $19.9. as did our 91 point rating. This is just a solid Napa Cabernet and hard to believe Costco can bring it in at only $20 our revie. 2016 Chateau Bel Air Gloria Haut-Medoc Cru Bourgeoi. We were pleasantly surprised here.  Retail price on this wine looks around $35 and Costco is selling it for $16.  The wine inside is more of what you would expect for $3. making it a huge find this year for us.  Hope to see this one back in future vintages our revie. 2019 Kirkland Signature Suscol Vineyard Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvigno. We were thrilled to see this new Kirkland offering back in stores.  The 2018 vintage was its inaugural vintag. and this new 2019 delivered the goods once again.  Costco has a serious winner with this win. and I know many of you wrote in to agree our revie. 2019 My Favorite Neighbor Cabernet Sauvigno. We are still amazed to have run into this bottle at Costco. Just straight fire in a high end Cabernet that’s not inexpensive ($45.99. but worth every penny.  We put a couple in the cellar; wouldn’t mind having a few more our revie. 2019 Four Graces Pinot Noir Willamette Valle. Retail price is $3. and only $20 at Costc. this is a perennial favorite Pinot from Willamette Valley that might still be lingering out there. Keep an eye out. Delicious juice our revie. 2016 Bodegas Sierra Salinas Mira Salinas Alicant. We loved this Spanish red that comes with a little age built in; $14.99 at Costco which is what you will find it for elsewher. so the only gripe is we’d like to see if come in a few bucks cheaper; but so much to like here; we went 91 points our revie. 2018 Chateau FaugeresCalice de FaugeresSaint-Emilion Grand Cr. Here’s a Saint Emilion Bordeaux that snuck in at the last minut. and what a wine this turned out to be; $2. super elegan. 91 points from us and even higher from most critics our revie.

2018 Devois des Agneaux d’Aumelas Languedoc,We weren’t sure what to expect here but had a sneaking suspicion that this might be an under the radar winner.  And we were spot on. Languedoc is a region in Southern Franc. in between the Mediterranean and Rhone Valle. and you can see the Rhone influence in the varietal blend here which is 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache. It’s a region also known for good value. as this one is the perfect case in point. Only $12.99 at Costco.  So we knew right away if it tasted as we hope. we were going back in for more. The placard notes a nice big 91 point score from Wine Advocate too.. On the pour this is a medium purple with dark frui. earth and herbs on the nose; flavors of blackberr. blueberry and plum with some dark chocolate in the finish. Elegant and subtle. We really like this one and the style is right up our alley.  Definitely plan to buy a few more if they’re still around. But word might get out fast among French wine fans that this is a bargain not to be missed. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 169490.

2018 Chateau Faugeres Calice de Faugeres Saint-Emilion Grand Cru,We thought this one might overdeliver and it does.  This is a great Costco wine find.  We’re big Bordeaux fan. and for $2. this is a score. Online the price seems to be closer to the $28 rang. so it appears Costco’s bringing it in at a competitive buy.  Suckling has gone in the low 90’s on some of the prior vintages.  And as far as Bordeaux vintages g. 2018 is one of our favorites. Since this wine hails from the right bank of Bordeaux (Saint Emilion) it will be Merlot dominated as indicated on the back label.  Likely smaller parts Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. The more we taste this on. the more boxes it checks.  The wine starts with lovely aromas of dark frui. herbs and spice; it is medium plus in body with good acidity; flavors of cherr. plu. and vanilla notes; dusty and dry in the finish. The first word that comes to mind in summarizing this one is elegant.  It’s just a delicat. well mad. well balanced Bordeaux that we can really get behind.  91 points from us with a big thumbs up.

2016 Bodegas Sierra Salinas Mira Salinas Alicante,There are quite a few interesting things about this bottle we found at Costc. which we’ve never seen before. First is the mistake on the Costco placar. labeling this wine as a Rioj. which would lead you to believe it was comprised of Tempranillo.  But the wine is actually from Alicante and is comprised of 100% Monastrell. Either wa. we’re coo. because Spain remains a favorite and the wine turned out to be absolutely stellar. Nex. let’s look at the price.  Costco is selling the wine for $14.99 which matches what Wine.com is selling it for (and retail looks to be $18).  It’s rare that Costco doesn’t beat Wine.co. so perhaps it’s a little high for us Costco shoppers who are used to saving a few extra bucks. The critic scores for this wine are consistently stron. all 90. every vintag. multiple outlets.  That’s usually a good sig. and in this case we did feel they were spot on. The wine is just drinking beautifully right now.  It’s had some time to rest and that’s apparent right away. The tannins are soft and it just feels great in the mouth. The wine is dark ruby on the pour with red and dark frui. eart. and a touch of spice on the nose; flavors of black cherr. blackberr. plum and notes of anise and dark chocolate; elegant in its deliver. subtle but lasting and strong in the finish. . If we bought this for $30-$40 we wouldn’t be disappointed.  It’s that goo. and the wine is in a perfect place right now.  Don’t cellar for too lon. open and enjoy.  We’ll put on our Top Picks list with a big thumbs up. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 169006. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. GA (Kennesaw. 14.5.

2020 Kirkland Signature Napa Valley Red Blend,Here’s a popular Kirkland wine hitting stores right on schedul. usually in the Sept-Oct timeframe.  We’ve heard from several readers who found this wine weeks before we di. so hopefully it’s beginning to make its way into more stores. Two things right off the bat.  Ye. the price stayed the same at $10.99.  That’s a huge factor for this bottl. because we feel the quality has been steadily improvin. while the price is staying consistent.  We like that equation. Next is a brand new label desig. and we’re fans. The previous black label was a good change from the really basic old white ones.  But it kind of ran its course.  This is a classy new look. Let’s recap our scores over the years on this red blend and as you can see this past 2019 vintage was a clear favorite. 2019 – 89 point. 2018– 86 point. 2016– 86 point. 2015– 86 point. 2014– 86 points (the wine was labeled as a Meritage with this vintag. instead of red blend. After hovering in the mid 80’s we finally got a big win with the 2019 vintage.  The change there was that the blend went from being more Merlot dominated to Cabernet Sauvignon dominated. . Now we like both (right and left bank) style. but for this bottlin. the Cab works much better.  And thankfully that’s what we have with the 2020 vintage. The varietal makeup is 76% Cabernet Sauvigno. 11% Merlo. 5% Petit Verdo. 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petite Sirah. Glen Hugo has also been named as the winemaker for several vintages in a ro. and this 2020 one is the first time we don’t see his name on the back of the label.  Not sure if there was a change mad. but it’s worth noting. On the pour this wine is a dee. dark purple with aromas of dark frui. cigar box and herbs; full bodie. and nicely balanced in the mouth; flavors of mostly dark frui. black cherr. blackberr. some dark chocolate; finish is chalky dry with good acidity. This is a very nice wine at an amazing price.  We’re going to bump our score up a poin. and claim this to be the best version of this red blend that we’ve tasted.  An incredible bargain for only $1. and wine we will add to our Top Picks list. Nice job Costco. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Blog Top Pick. Costco item number: 33311.

2016 Marques del Atrio Rioja Reserva,This is the second year now (last time was Sept 2020) that this fantastic Rioja sees a huge limited time discoun. taking what is already an amazing wine for $1. down to only $8.99.

2022 Costco Wine Advent-ure Calendar,It’s hard to believe it’s that time alread. but here we are just closing out summer and ba. we get the Costco wine advent calendar hitting store. alongside Christmas trees and holiday decorations. This is about the same time of the year when last years Advent Calendar droppe. first week of September.  It always seems like a challenge to hold this out for three months and actually enjoy the wines during the day in December they are intended for (we’ve obviously never been able to get close). One of the first things you notice is another cool box design.  Whoever makes these boxes does a really nice job in our opinion.  Catch. compelling and fun.  And they look great stacked like this at the entrance. The next thing you’ll notice is the price has stayed the same at $99.99.  From the first box up until last yea. the price has remained $99.99.  And in past years actually there’s even been more than one Costco Wine Advent Calenda. both coming in at $99.99. That’s a relative bargain for the amount of wine you get. Each box still comes with twenty four 375ml bottles (1/2 size of regular wine bottles) for what nets out to about $4 for each 1/2 bottle. And as we mention in our previous reviews of the Costco wine boxe. these small bottles are super convenient when you want open a few different style. when you just want a glass of tw. or when traveling.  We love to start with a white while cooking and move to a red with a meal.  This is perfect for that. There’s no indication on the box this year of what wines are insid. so we’ll list them at the end of this review for those who are curious.  If you have the will power to buy a box and wait until December 1 to begin enjoying the. you might not want to scroll all the way down this page. But at a high leve. they come from Franc. Spai. Portuga. Moldov. Georgia and Italy to name a few places.  There are a couple indigenous grapes in here we’ve never heard o. so that’s always fun.  A box like this is a great way to expand your wine knowledge.  We learned a lot just writing this up. The 2022 Costco Wine Advent-ure Calendar is once again supported by a great website from the producer that has descriptions and background on each wine and a video with additional information. For Australian buyers there’s a slightly different website listed this year (which ironically contains wines from last years U.S. box if I’m reading it right). We’d love to post about each of these wine. but in the interest of getting this information out to you fas. we typically open four bottles to taste and review.  Choosing the wines was done completely random by our 11 year old and we ended up with two whites and two reds.  There are also a couple of rose wines as part of the bo. but no bubbly this time aroun. which was usually in the lineup for Dec 24. The wines we tasted and a few notes on them. Moon Meadow Chardonnay (Italy. Pours pretty clear with a light yellow tint; stone fruit on the nose; lemo. lim. citrus fruit flavo. clea. little to no oak.  We rather enjoyed this Chardonnay. El Campeo. Fernao Pires (Portugal. This is a unique blend of Fernão Pires and Branco Arint. two native grapes we’ve never tasted before.  The wine is a light gold color with grapefruit and peach flavor; it is brigh. crisp and acidi. reminiscent in some ways of a Viognier with a lighter body. . Crowned Beas. Saperavi (Georgia. This might be the first time we remember tasting Saperavi from Georgia.  In the glass this one pours a medium purple with a dust. earthy nose; mostly dark frui. the wine is youthful with a little rustic undertone.  Super fun to try. The Butcher. Cabernet Sauvignon (Moldova. This wine pours a dark ruby with black cherry and red licorice on the nose; it is full bodied with good dept. big and strong; our favorite of the tasting. So a good start to the bo. and we already uncovered a few of the more interesting wines.  Stop here if you don’t want to know any more of the wines that are included. Here they are by day. Day 1 – Right Hook Cabernet Sauvignon (Bulgaria. Day 2 – Moon Meadow Chardonnay (Italy. Day 3 – Birds on a Wir. Red Blend (Portugal. Day 4 – Disheveled Tailo. Königliche(Hungary. Day 5 – Latitude 40 Grenache (Spain. Day 6 – Divine Ponderin. Pinot Noir (North Macedonia. Day 7 – Proper Etiquett. Chenin Blanc (South Africa. Day 8 – Crowned Beas. Saperavi (Georgia.

Tempranillo (Spain. Day 14 – The Perfect Matc. Merlot (France. Day 15 – Little Ditt. Macabeo (Spain. Day 16 – Point Taken.  This is interesting.  According to the Wine Advent-ure Websit. you might find either a South African Shiraz or a French Bordeaux. Day 17 – Here Kitty Kitt. Trebianno (Italy. Day 18 – Nightfal. Monstrell (Spain.

If anyone sees it near them and can confirm the $99.99 pricing that would be helpful.  If you see it for $139.9. please share the location you saw that.

2017 Dueling Pistols Red Blend Paso Robles,O. we’ll admit i. the label sucked us in pretty fast here.  Love this desig. and we couldn’t wait to flip the bottle around to see what this was all about. . Usually we try to stay away from wines that are trying hard to be somethin. but this one (along with some of the Aussie wines with a lot of character) just seemed to work for us. First of. it’s a Paso Robles wine.  We remain huge fans of wines from this are. and for Californi. we feel you’d be hard pressed to find better quality for the price than you can get from Paso Robles. The blend is interesting too. 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 50% Petite Sirah.  O. we can work with tha. and it’s a nice change of pace. The wine earned 91 points from Wine Enthusiast too. Costco’s price at $33.29 is pretty good; retail online seems to be around $44.  It’s still a fair amount to spend on a blend like thi. but we actually really enjoyed it.  It didn’t hurt we paired it up with some grilled burgers on a perfec. late summer evenin. but there’s a lot to like here no matter how you want to enjoy it. It’s a dark deep dark ruby on the pour with black fruit and herbs on the nose; dark fruit flavo. mostly plu. blackberry and blueberry towards the finish.  It’s a big win. juicy but not sweet as these blends sometimes are.. Really a lot of fu. and nice to try something different.  We’re fan. and would definitely buy this one again.

2018 Mosquita Muerta Pispi Blend de Tintas,We dropped this one in the cart just for purposes of exploration for this site.  We’ve never seen or tasted this Argentinean red blend before. On the placard you’ll see the 92 points the wine received from Wine Advocate.  We couldn’t find a true retail price for the bottle.  Online it really varies but most outlets seem to have it in the $20 range so $15 at Costco seems like a good buy. The blend here is Malbec (40%. Cabernet Franc (10%. Merlot (10%. Petit Verdot (20%) and Bonarda (20%).  We aren’t always fans of these types of blend. but every once in a while you come across a ge. and that’s exactly what we found here.

2019 Four Graces Pinot Noir Willamette Valley,We knew we had tasted this bottle a few times but a subsequent search of the site shows the last time we reviewed it was all the way back in April of 2016 with the 2013 vintage. So I’m glad we’re getting in a fresh review of a new vintage because this wine is once again a big time winner at a fantastic Costco price. Retail price seems to be around $30 with Wine.com and others selling it in the high $20 range. The 2013 vintage was $22.99 at Costco and the new one is even lower at $19.8. which is great news. Suckling went 92 points which we felt is about right this time. Tasting notes for this 2019 are pretty similar to the 2013 vintag. the key takeaway being eleganc. which once again came through big time for us.. This one pours a medium ruby in the glass with earthy red berry fruit on the nose; it is medium in body with soft tannins and a subtle acidic bite; flavors of sour cherr. light Dr Peppernotes; there’s a touch of dark chocolate in the pleasant finish.. This wine just knows exactly what it wants to be.  We are big fans once agai. and will continue to keep this bottle on our Top Picks list.  Our rating will stay the same at 91 points with a big thumbs up. Cheers. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 49618. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant.

2019 My Favorite Neighbor Cabernet Sauvignon,We can’t believe we ran into this wine at Costco. My Favorite Neighbor is among the darlings of the wine world right now it seems. Stories praising this wine seem to be on regular rotation on our Apple News feed. We first tried it in the 2018 vintage at a steakhouse (Flame in Springfiel. MO of all places) and couldn’t believe how well it held up to the hype. It was delicious and the price was very reasonable (2X retail at the restaurant so it was $95). At Costco we just found it for $45.9. which is about what you will find it for at other outlets including Total Win. so don’t get bummed if it’s not at your Costco; keep an eye out at other stores too. You’re not missing out on a lot of price difference by buying it at Costco in this case. Retail price is $50. The critic ratings are super high for a wine under $50. The 2019 vintage pulled down 96 points from Wine Advocate and 95 points from Wine Enthusiast; it received 95 points for the 2018 vintage from Wine Advocate. This vintage is comprised of fruit from San Luis Obispo County (prior vintage was Paso Robles. and it’s got a little more to it than just Cab. The makeup is 77% Cabernet Sauvigno. 11% Petit Verdo. 8% Petite Sira. 3% Syrah and 1% Malbec. Getting into the win. it pours a dark ruby in the glass with red frui. herbs and spice on the nose; on the palate there’s a nice combo of red and dark fruit flavo. a good dose of black cherry with some mocha notes towards the finish; silky tannins; medium plus in body with a strong finish. This is just a really well-made wine that seems like it could cost 2-3X what it does. Fans of wines like Austin Hope looking for something in a similar price range that just overdelivers will find a lot to like here. We can’t wait to follow this exciting brand into future vintages.

2021 Kirkland Signature Cotes De Provence Rosé,Look what’s back in stores and right on time.  We usually see the Kirkland Cotes De Provence Rose hit stores in the July 4th timeframe. And be awar. these bottles move fast.  Like really fast.  We wouldn’t be surprised to see them cleared out in the next few weeks.  So if you’ve enjoyed it in the pas. and/or find this review compellin. you might want to stock up. Right off the ba. you’ll note the price has stayed the same (for the most par. actually 10 cents cheaper).  Two vintages ag. it had climbed to $9.9. and then it came back down for some reason. We’ve always enjoyed this wine.  Here are our historical ratings. 201690 point. 201790 point. 201889 point. 201989 point. 2020 90 point. I guess many of you agre. which is why this one moves through stores so fast. This year’s blend is slightly different than the previous vintage. It consists of 43% Grenach. 28% Cinsaul. 10% Syra. 8% Vermentin. 5% Carigna. 4% Ugni Blanc and 2% Mourvedre. Last year’s blend had a little Tibouren in it.  It is the same winemaker as year’s past. Our tasting notes year to year are very similar.  So as you can gues. this new vintage is a big time winne. once again. The wine is a pale salmon on the pour with strawberr. red berry and white peach flavors; light tangines. super crisp. Right on par with previous vintage. and probably one of the best Kirkland buys we’ll see in stores this year. As we said before don’t wait.  If you like French rose or have enjoyed this one in the pas. stock up when you can.  The price is righ. it’s drinking perfectl. and it pairs really well with the summer season. Cheers.

2019 Whitehall Lane Sauvignon Blanc,Nothing pairs with summer like a crisp and delicious Sauvignon Blan. and that’s exactly what we have here. This is our first time tasting this wine so we didn’t know what to expect but it definitely met and ultimately exceeded our expectations. Only doing the research now after having already tasted and making our note. do we realize that every single wine critic rated this wine 90 points (and pretty much the same for past vintages of it too).  That includes Wine Spectato. Wine Enthusias. Wine Advocat. and James Suckling.  You can also add CostcoWineBlog to that list now. A few other interesting things to note before we get into the notes.  Retail price is $25 and we found it online at Total Wine for $23 so Costco’s $15.99 price point is pretty compelling. In Googling around we also learned the wine is blended with 11% Sémillon. In the glass this wine pours a medium straw-yellow with vibrant citrus and vanilla on the nose; it is medium in body with more citrus fruit on the palat. flavors of white peac. green apple; good acidity and super crisp.. We enjoyed this one on a hot Atlanta day and it hit the spot for everyone who tasted it with us.  Just a lovely win. perfectly assemble. and exactly what we hoped it would be.

2018 Stags’ Leap Winery Petite Sirah,This is a classic Napa bottle that we were surprise. but delighte. to find at Costco.  We’ve visited this winery a couple of times and have tasted many vintages of their Petite Sira. always enjoying the. along with most of the other wines Stags’ Leap Winery offers. Note: Stags’ Leap Winery and Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars are two different entities.  Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars produces the popular Artemis Cabernet that can often be found at Costco and we reviewed a couple years ago. Pricewis. Costco brought this Petite Sirah in a little below other outlets at $29.99.  Total Wine carries it for  $31.99 and Wine.com for $36.99.  On the placard above it lists the Suckling score at 97 points. But in our online searches we show him giving it 93 points so we think that may be a mistake. Getting into it…the wine pours a medium purple in the glass and is loaded with deep dark frui. blackberr. blueberry flavor. plenty of spice; super grippy tannins and some earth. vegetal notes; dry throughout and especially in the finish. We’re big fans. This bottle is perfect when you’re looking for something a little different.  It would also be a great pick to bring to a wine party.  And of cours. pop it open with some grilled meats this summer.. We’ll be adding this one to our Top Picks list.. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick.

2020 Kirkland Signature Chateauneuf du Pape,Finall. we found this.  Just like many of you have trouble finding the wines we review her. we also sometimes have trouble finding the ones our readers recommend.  Each trip to the stor. we cross our fingers hoping to find them. The new Kirkland Chateauneuf has been out for a whil. and readers have reported good things.  This is always a treat to find and a reminder why we shop at Costco.  I’m still fascinated by the fact that they produce this win. and offer it at such a good price. . In fact this yea. that price dropped back down to $19.99 where it was priced for a long time.  Last vintage it crept up to $21.9. so we are happy to see it return to under $20. This is likely one of the Kirkland bottles we’ve tasted the most over the years. Here’s a look back at of our historical ratings for the Kirkland Signature Chateauneuf du Pape. 2019 88 point. 2018 90 Point. 2016 90 Point. 2015 89 Point. 2014 88 Point. 2013 93 Point. 2012 91 Point. 2011 92 Point. 2010 91 Point. 2009 91 Point. The varietal breakdown is the same as the past three vintages: 70% Grenach. 10% Syra. 10% Mourvedre and 10% Cinsault.  Our tasting notes are also very similar to prior vintages but we’re finding this one to have more in common with the very good 2018 vintage rather than the 2019. In the glass the wine is a medium ruby with spic. earthy aromas; mostly dark frui. blackberr. blueberr. black cherry; the wine is peppery into the finish with nice acidit. dry and lingering in the close.  Nice structure and depth. This is just a classic Chateauneuf du Pape at a great price.  Having dropped down to a still respectable 88 points with the prior vintag. we’re going to bump this one back up to 90 points and put on our Recommended wine list.  Also a good pick to cellar for a few more years. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 77766. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. GA (Kennesa. GA. Alc. 15.5.

2019 Kirkland Signature Suscol Vineyard Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,For those who follow our accounts on social medi. you’ve no doubt seen a few people post about this bottle making a reappearance in stores right now. This is the Kirkland Signature Suscol Napa Caberne. single vineyard.  This wine debuted last year with the dynamite 2018 vintag. and pretty much everyone I heard fro. including u. loved it.  Among the Kirkland portfolio Cabernet. it was clearly towards the top of the list. When readers said it returne. I was overjoye. and was hoping I’d run into it before it sells through.  You can see from the picture below there were only about 10-12 bottles lef. stuffed on one side of the wooden bin.  This location (Dalla. GA) now has half that many after I found it.  This one moves fast. And great news that the price stayed the same at $16.99.  I hate saying this on the blo. but this one could easily go for more so kudos to Costco for giving us an amazing price on this wine. The big hope is that this 2019 vintage delivers like the prior vintag. and we could tell on the first taste that it does indeed. The wine pours a deep dark ruby in the glas. signature Napa nos. and you can tell pretty quick this is a step up from your average Napa Cab; full bod. good acidity and just massive flavor delivered so perfectly. Flavors are predominantly black cherry and dark berry fruit with some plum and dark chocolate; dry acidity in the finish that sticks around forever. I wrote these notes before re-reading my notes on the prior year and they are super similar.  So if you enjoyed this wine last tim. get ready for more.  I already did a mini stock u. but at this pric. this is a wine you can’t have enough of on hand. We’ll be keeping our rating consist at 91 point. and will once again add this bottle to our Top Picks list.  Cheers. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a Costco Wine BlogTop Pick.

2018 Smith &amp; Hook Red Blend Central Coast,Here’s a Costco wine staple that we enjoy vintage to vintage.  And it’s a little behind schedule this yea. arriving in June vs November 1.5 years ag. when we reviewed the 2017 vintage. But better late than neve. and we have high hopes for this 2018 vintage.  Great news right off the bat is the price stayed the same at $15.99. The blend again is Merlo. Malbe. Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvigno. and they do such a good job bringing these grapes together.  That hodgepodge could really go sideways fas. and long time readers know we’re not always a fan of these types of blends. Smith &amp; Hook consistently does it right though. The wine is a dark ruby in the glas. dark berry fruit and wet soil on the nose; full bodied with some good acidity; blueberry and plum flavor leading into a nice dry finish.  Really an enjoyable wine all around and a “field” blend that actually stays interesting. If you aren’t yet familiar with Smith &amp; Hoo. give these guys a shot; just about any bottle you can find from them.  They just seem to max out the bang for the buck we are all looking for. We reviewed the 2015 vintage of the Smith &amp; Hook blend a while back too and hadsimilar feelings. This one’s an easy addition to our Top Pickslist.

2019 Hyland Estates Old Vine Pinot Noir,Here’s an interesting fin. that we decided to pick up from the Pinot aisle.  It seems we’ve been drinking a fair amount of Pinot Noir but haven’t reviewed a lot of Costco bottles. We thought this might be fun because it’s from the McMinnville AVA in Willamette Valle. which is just a mecca for good juice nowadays.  Plus we recently reviewed the Kirkland Willamette Pinot Noir and thoroughly enjoyed it (89 points).  So we thought it be fun to see how this one stacked up. Costco’s price was $16.99 and online I’m finding a retail price of $4. with Wine.com offering the bottle for close to $30.  We didn’t know that at the time of purchas. but it is certainly one of the more substantial Costco discounts we’ve seen.  Plu. 90 points from Wine Enthusias. which in this case is right on the mark. In the glas. this wine pours a nice pale ruby with red berry and spice on the nose.  It is medium in body with flavors of cherr. col. raspberry and more pepper and spice into the finish; good acidity and wraps up nicely. It’s really a beauty all aroun. and a solid find for Pinot Noir under $20. We have a feeling when words gets out or those in the know see this on. it might disappear fast.  We’d love to keep a few on hand. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 115947. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. GA (Kennesaw. Alc. 13.8.

2020 Pendulum Cabernet Sauvignon Columbia Valley,We picked up this bottle for a couple different reasons. Firs. we love Columbia Valley wine. and Washington State wines overall. A while back we wrote a brief feature story about thi. “Reflections on Washington State Wines and Why Everyone Should Be Buying Them.. So we wanted to know if this is one of those bottle. that “everyone should buy.” Spoiler: it is. Nex. we have found the Red Blend from Pendulum before at Costco. It’s been a little whil. but it was fun to read the review again. We enjoyed the wine a lo. scoring it a solid 89 points and the blend was 62% Merlo. 26% Syrah and 12% Malbec. Leading into this straight Cabernet that just arrived in stores. At $11.99 this bottle is actually $1 less expensive than the blen. which is nice. The wine is a deep dark ruby on the pour with a juicy nose of eart. baking spice and dark berry fruit; more dark fruit flavor on the palate; blackberr. black cherry and plum; it is full bodied with a touch of vanill. and white chocolate into dry finish. Really a nice wine and superb for the price. Historicall. this wine has pulled down some low 90’s ratings which is impressive. I didn’t find much on this 2020 vintage. We’re going to rate it right there at 90 point. one point up from the blend. This is a delicious WA State find and an excellent red wine buy under $15.

2016 Chateau Bel Air Gloria Haut-Medoc Cru Bourgeois,Here’s one of those fun affordable Bordeaux finds that pop up occasionally in Costco. This one actually appeared in the wooden boxes as opposed to the “cheap seats” (stacks of wine aisle) where the sub $20 ones often are found. You’ll notice the word Gloria in the nam. and a quick Google search tells us that Chateau Bel Air is part of Domaines Henri Marti. which also owns Chateau Gloria in Saint-Julien. Just kind of an interesting side note. We’ve tasted several vintages of Chateau Gloria and have enjoyed them. They are among the more reasonably priced bottles you can find from Saint Julien. This wine is from Haut-Medoc and has the Cru Bourgeois classificatio. which means the wine meets higher quality standards. And it does indeed meet high quality standards in our opinion. Wine Enthusiast agrees too awarding this wine 93 points. Costco’s price is really good at $15.9. considering retail is around $25; Wine Enthusiast listed it highest at $35. On the pour the wine is a medium to dark rub. classic Bordeaux aroma. stinky barnyar. pencil shavings; the wine is medium plus in body and really well balanced. Good acidity with savory flavors of dark cherr. plum and blackberry. All around this is a strong Bordeaux buy and the price is perfect. You’d be hard pressed to find better reds for $1. especially if you enjoy Bordeaux and other old world wines. We’re big fans. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 92 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick.

2019 Kirkland Signature Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon,Among Costco wine. particularly those in the Kirkland portfoli. it is really hard to beat the Oakville Cabernet for $20. This new 2019 vintage arrived right on tim. usually Feb-March.  We’re happy to see the price stay the same at $19.99.  It was $18.99 a few years back but has been holding steady at $19.99 which is great. There are few other bottles out there from this premier Napa region to compare to in this price range. Most are $40 and up. Historicall. this wine has delivered time and time again. 2018 91 point. 201790 point. 201690 point. 201591 point. 201390 point. So we’re looking at 90 point scores from us for every year we’ve reviewed this wine (which I think is also every year that’s it’s been produced; still not sure what happened in 2014).  And we’re going to keep this run going with the 2019 vintag. which we felt was once agai. spectacular. The wine pours a medium to deep ruby in the glass; red frui. earth and perfume aromas; there’s a nice red and black fruit contrast with cherr. raspberr. plum and pomegranate; we’re picking up more red fruit in this 2019 compared to our notes from the prior vintage. Some dark chocolate notes in the finish; good acidit. grippy tannins lead into a nice dry finish.  There is so much to like here.  This is just a signature Oakville Cab at a rather unheard of price point.  We’ll be (once again) adding this bottle to our Top Picks list. If this sounds like your kind of win. or if you’ve enjoyed prior vintage. I’d pick up a few bottles as this one tends to move fast. Nice job Costco.

2019 Adegas Tollodouro Pontellon Albarino Rias Baixas,It seems like the prices keep creeping up on Albarino as word gets out about how good they are.  I put Gruner Veltliner in that same bucket.  You used to see them under $1. and now that’s quite rar. and most are closer to $20.  Except at Costco. This is exactly the kind of white wine we’re on the look out for at Costco: something a little different than the usual Chardonnay/SB player. crisp and enjoyable with nearly all cuisin. and a white that tastes as great during the colder months as it does during the summer. And the price was right too at $11.9. which is pretty hard to match with any other Albarino nowadays.  Costco should buy a massive lot of this wine and brand this as a future Kirkland Signature Albarino.  We’d love to see that. The wine is $16 at Total Wine and that looks to be about the best price online. It received 90 points from Wine Enthusiast who lists a retail price of $27.  And it also received 93 points from Wine &amp; Spirits. So we’re not alone in finding this one interesting. The wine pours a pale to medium yellow with aromas of citrus fruit and a little butterscotch; it is medium in bod. super crisp with balanced acidity; flavors of green appl. aprico. and white peach; finishes really nice.  This is just a solid package all around and the price is amazing. . I’d stock up on this one if you like Albarino or if it sounds up your alley after reading this; it drinks better than many of the others we’ve found at Costco and elsewhere.

This marks the third vintage of this wine to be release. and in looking back over past review. you can see that we rated both the 2015 vintage and 2016 vintage 92 points.

There’s lots of good news her. but let’s start with the price that has stayed the same at only $19.9. which is as about as low as you will find Barolo.  There are a few drinkable exceptions though. Let’s get into this new vintage. The wine pours a pale garnet in the glass; spic. black cherry aromas; medium body with great acidity; flavors of cherr. raspberr. anise; really good depth to this wine and the finish is remarkabl. just digging in and lasting forever..

2019 Chento Malbec,You’d have to be a long time reader of this blog to remember the last time we found the Chento Malbec at Costco.  It was all the way back in July of 2016 when we found the 2012 vintage for $13.89. The opening line in that review state. “Massive bargain here. Great wine at a great price.”  Well now it’s back with the 2019 vintage and it is once again an awesome Costco wine find. . The price has gone up slightly to $14.6. but retail is around $20 so it’s still a great bargain. You can jump over to here to Wine.com and see all the 90+ point reviews over the past few years too. Note the 94 points from Suckling proudly displayed not only on the Costco placard but around the band on the bottle’s neck. In the glass the wine pours a dark purple and has earthy dark fruit aromas; it is medium plus body with good acidity; flavors are mostly dark frui. black cherr. plu. black licorice; really a perfect finish that brings it all together.

2018 Susana Balbo Malbec,Here’s another limited time discount Costco wine fin. that essentially knocks the price in half compared to its full retail of around $20. . Normally $16.99 at Costc. the limited time $6 off (until 2/13) brings it down to only $10.99.  And this wine is pretty amazing.  I’d jump on this while you can. Here’s a screen shot from Wine.com for this wine showing the ratings across a few different vintages.  All 90’s. Quite remarkable for a wine you can score for $10 right now at Costco.  I only noticed this after I had tasted i. and my score fell right in line. This wine pours a medium purple with a spic. earthy nose; mostly dark frui. blackberr. plu. some dark chocolate; there’s toasty oak in the finish; really nice depth.  The blend has some Cab Franc in it too (8%) which was a nice complement. A seriously impressive wine that’s hard to beat for $10.  Grab these before this discount runs ou. and add this wine to your list of go to bottles.  . CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 99752.

2018 Acclaimed Red Wine Napa,We just drove through Jacksonvill. FL and found a nice Costco along the route (St Johns store. so we picked up a few bottles to review in the weeks to come.  Great selection by the wa. and we found a few interesting items that we’re interested in exploring. Note: usually we only buy a couple bottles at a time to keep what we review fresh on the site but this store had some fun ones so we picked up quite a few.  Hope they are goo. and if s. we hope that they pop up near you. We will start with the wines we found that had a limited time Costco discount. The first of which is this red blend from Napa.  The Acclaimed brand is part of Precision Wine Co.’s portfolio whose wines pop up at Costco and we’ve reviewed a few of them before. There’s not a lot of information online about this wine but obviously the sustantial Costco price discount caught my eye.  Retail appears to be around $3. with Costco’s standard price being $22.99.  When you tack on the $9 extra discount it brings it all the way down to $13.99.  This offer is good through 2/13. So great pric. but that’s not the only highlight.  We really enjoyed this wine.  It’s subtle and restraine. not a giant California fruit bomb by any means.  Cherry on the nos. medium to medium plus in bod. it just feels great in the mouth. Lots of dark frui. black cherr. black curran. plum with a touch of vanilla. Acidic and dry into the finish.  2018 was a great vintage in Napa and this is a real trea. especially at this price.  A nice Costco wine find for sur. and a wine that we will add to our Top Picks list. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 158836.

2011 Bodegas Olarra Otonal Gran Reserva Rioja,What a find this turned out the be.  Rarely to do see a Gran Reserva Rioja for $15 so I was a little skeptical and remember being burned by an inexpensive one several years ago.  But this is the reason you shop at Costco.  To uncover gems like this. . All the agin. or at least the first par. has been done for you here.  This is a 2011 vintage that you’re buying right off the shelf in 202. so you get a nice decade plus of age built into the wine without having to store anything yourself. . And let’s jump back to that price.  $14.99 at Costco.  Retail looks to be between $35-$50 from a few online searche. so this is a huge discount at Costco.  And 94 points from Decanter.  We’ve found a few treasures like this in the pas. but also have hit a few duds.  This on. fortunately landed among the former. The wine pours a medium ruby with a little garnet showing around in the rim; dust. dried fruit on the nose showing the signs of a touch of age but still very much alive and vibrant; it is medium bodied; slightly muted fruit on the first pour that developed more after a decant. There’s a nice combo of red and dark fruit flavo. black cherr. raspberry and some plum; leathery and acidic into a very delicate finish. This is a really nice wine that is super fun to drink right now.. If you like aged wines and don’t want to have to cellar yourself for a few year. this is a perfect choice.  If you’re not sure if you like older wine. this is a good one to tast. because it’s in a perfect drinking windo. just showing the first signs of its age while being very accessible.

2018 Mount Veeder Winery Cabernet Sauvignon,This one seems to make frequent Costco appearance. and I would have bet anything that we had reviewed it in the pas. but a quick search didn’t turn anything up.  So I’m glad I grabbed it this time. We’re big Mount Veeder fan. particularly after a tour of Mayacamas we were lucky enough to join a few years bac. which is one of my favorite properties in the area.  Surprisingl. Costco carried the Mayacamas Chardonnay for a short period of time.  That is a beautiful wine to put in memory if you ever come across it. Lagier Meredith is another amazing winery nearby to look for too. There seems to be some misinformation out there about the blend for this ’18 Ca. but according to the Mount Veeder winery website it is: 94% Cabernet Sauvigno. 3% Malbec and 3% Merlot. I saw other reports of 82% Cabernet Sauvigno. 8% Merlo. 6% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec. Retail price is $5. online it can be scored for $46 so we’re getting a nice big Costco discount for $35.  Plus virtually all 90 point scores from the critics across the board with Suckling going as high as 95 points.  Sounds promising…and it is. The wine pours a deep purple in the glass with red fruit on the nose; in the mout. loads of black cherr. with some raspberr. and notes of dark chocolate; the wine is fresh and vibrant; it’s acidic and super dry in the finish with lingering peppe. This is tasty juice and it improved with a little air so give it a decant if you can.  I know many readers are looking for affordable bottles that are cellarable and will develop with a little age.  Pop this one on that list.  2018 was a great vintag. and this one has room to run. . CostcoWineBlog.com Rating:91 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. GA (Dalla. GA.

2016 Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,There’s some history behind this win. and the copy on the back label gives a nice overview if you are able to read that from the second image below. But in shor. Buena Vista was established in 1857 and is considered by many to be the first premium winery in California.  I’ve been meaning to pick this one up to taste it and finally pulled the trigger on my last trip. This is not an inexpensive wine but Costco’s price of $32.99 is more than fair for a wine of this caliber.  The retail seems to be around $50.  This time of the yea. when you’re perhaps more likely to splurge on a fine win. you couldn’t do much better than this in the price range. Definitely decant.  The wine was a little tight on the initial pou. but we came back to it 45 minutes later and it was right where we wanted this to be. Deep ruby in the glas. ripe frui. cigar bo. earthy aromas; the wine is medium plus to full body; mostly dark frui. black cherr. blackberr. plum flavors;  a little dark chocolate.  Nice acidity and sticky tannins lead to a dry chalky finish. Overal. this is a clear winner among Napa wine. and a solid choice from the region for under $40.  Great vintage too.

2019 Kirkland Signature Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon,Here’s a Kirkland wine favorite we are always excited to see hit store. the Rutherford Cabernet. This marks the third vintage we’ve tasted. Previousl. this was actually a Rutherford Meritage blen. but with the 2016 vintage it became a straight Cab. We also seemed to have missed the 2017 vintage if one was produced; not sure about that. But historically speakin. this bottle one is climbing the charts with our ratings. 201. 89 point. $17.9. 201. 92 point. $18.9. Small price jump with the 201. but that stabilized with the 2019 which is great. For Rutherford Caberne. it is hard to find something like this bottle for under $20. And it drinks like it cost 2X that price. The 2019 fell right in line with similar tasting notes and remains an amazing Costco wine find. This wine pours a deep dark ruby in the glass with a fres. aromatic nos. very Napa in style. It is full bodied and super dry and grippy as these wines tend to be. Nice combo of fruit flavor. led by dark frui. blackberr. blueberry and plum along with some cherry and red licorice; similar to the prior yea. but perhaps a tad more red fruit flavor in the mix. Moving into the finish there’s a little vanilla and mocha. This is a winner and fans of these wines in the past will again find a lot to like here. We’re going to stay at 92 points and again add to our Top Picks list. As far as Napa Cabs g. this is really hard to beat especially considering the very fair price point.

2017 Copain Tous Ensemble Chardonnay,Clearly the first thing that stands out here is the massive limited time discount that might be about as hefty as we’ve ever seen in the wine aisle at Costco.  And what makes it even better is that it’s applied to a delicious wine. Costco’s standard price on this bottle is $21.9. which is below the retail of $28 and the online price around $2. depending on the outlet (Wine.com and Total Wine were in that range).  But the massive $10.50 limited time Costco discount brings this one down to only $11.49 which is pretty amazing.  I bought three; should have bought more. The wine pours a deep gold with lemon and vanilla cream on the nose; it is ligh. just pushing medium in body with flavors of green appl. lemon meringu. light cream and vanilla; some mineral notes and a little oak in the finish.  Really well balanced and presented nicely. This is a 90 pointer for me.  Wine Spectator went 9. and Wilfred Wong of Wine.com went 92. This is a high quality wine at a spectacular price.  Discount lasts until 12/19 if these bottles stick around until then. . CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 160088. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant.

2014 Torre de Ona Finca Martelo Rioja Reserva,Here’s a wine that I didn’t know much about when I bought i. or when I tasted i. but a little Internet sleuthing later turned up some pretty cool information that I’ll get to a minute. There are usually quite a few Rioja choices at Costc. including their own Kirkland bottling that is a good pick for only $8. I have a lot of readers asking our opinion of many of the. but like all things at Costc. not all of the ones that are sent in are able to be located at stores around me (thinking about you in particular Annie). Here’s a 2014 vintage Rioja Reserva that boasts a 94 point score from Wine Advocat. as well as 92 points from Wine Spectator and James Suckling. Looking online the retail price seems to be around $40-$50 so nice to find it at Costco for about half that ($25.79). The wine is a beautiful medium ruby in the glass; didn’t show signs of age; expressive nose of black cherry with a little spice and earth. Good red and dark fruit flavor combo with cherr. plum and blueberry. Medium to full bod. tannins are nice and mellow; perfec. lasting finish. It instantly reminded me of the La Rioja Alta 904 Rioja that I love so muc. and guess what that Internet sleuthing turned up? Both wines are produced by the same group. What a guess. The big difference? This one is half the price of the 904. The more we got into this win. the more we liked it. This is a really special one and ridiculous at this price. I often get asked for collectible wines under $30 and this is one of those rare finds that fits the bill. It drinks really nice right no. but it might be fun to put some away for a few more years too. What a gem. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 93 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 154363.

2021 Costco Wine Thanksgiving Picks,It’s already that time of the year again.  It seems like just yesterday when we posted our 2020 Thanksgiving picks.  So here we are for another go aroun. and I tried to freshen these up this yea. sprinkling in some oldies but goodies. I know not everyone will be able to find these wine. so I went for a broad selection of wines we enjo. and photographed on a trip to Costco just last night. . I hope some of these are available near yo. but as you kno. this is really hit or miss.  You can always call your Costco and ask if they carry the item number which is pictured on the Costco placard signs. Overall for Thanksgivin. our motto is typically anything goes.  There are so many different types of food and flavors you really can’t find a one-bottle homerun. . Rathe. we like to try some different styles and varietal. having fun with the wine and the food without a lot of structure. . So let’s get into it. Elk Cove Pinot Noi. We’re going to kick this off with a Pinot Noi. which might be among the more versatile wines you can choose.  We reviewed and loved the Pinot Blanc from Elk Cove a little while bac. and their Pinot Noir is equally strong and a solid buy for $22. Erath Pinot Noi. We’ll stick with the Pinot for a secon. and highlight the Erath Pinot from Orego. which is always a solid Costco pick for around $15. Read our review. Stag’s Leap Cellars Karia Chardonna. It’s been a while since we’ve reviewed this wine to. but it’s nice to see it back at Costco.  This is a really delicious Chardonnay that we used to be able to score for $19.9. but the price has been slowly creeping up.  Still worth it. Our last review. Far Niente Chardonna. While we’re on Chardonna. we might as well throw out a big one.  Here’s the bottle to bring when you’re trying to impres. and impress you will.  This is really delicious wine. . I was almost certain we had posted a review about this bottl. but I can’t find it.  Regardles. this is a special special treat.  Price is creeping up here too; this used to be $49.99. But agai. still worth it. Domaine Drouhin Oregon Pinot Noi. The Drouhin Family has been making wine in France’s Burgundy region since 1880.  As you can imagin. they know a little bit about Pinot Noir and this Dundee Hills Oregon bottling is a super solid pick. . This is a good choice to impress your wine nerd friends. Value seekers: keep an eye out for their Cloudline Pinot Noir which Costco also carries for $14.99. Kirkland Signature K Vine Ros. This was an exciting new offering on the Kirkland Signature side of things created together with Charles Smit. who  makes theWines of Substance CS Cabernetthat is widely available at Costco that we always love. . A lot of mainstream wine writers are talking about rosé this Thanksgivin. so that could be a popular choice for befor. during or after the meal.  You can really crack rosé anytime. This is a fun one for $1. made with Syrah. Beringer Knights Valley Cabernet Sauvigno. This is a really solid Cabernet for the money that we’ve tasted several times and also enjoyed.  Keep an eye out too as sometimes around this time of the year Costco will carry this in the 1.5L big bottle which is awesome.  I still have some ’14s in my cellar I plan to open this season. Veuve Clicquot Brut Champagne Yellow Labe. You can’t beat the Veuve.  And you can’t beat this cool little insulated bag Costco is selling it in right now.  We reviewed this wine earlier this yea. mostly to see how it stacked up to other Champagne we were tasting and the answer is that it stood up very well. . This is just pure class.  I don’t think anyone would complain with you showing up with this for Thanksgiving. Last weeken. my friend JP brought a bottle over for a gathering at our place and it was thoroughly enjoyed by all.

2017 Numanthia Termes Espana Tinta de Toro,Spain is such a good place to look for value in the wine world nowadays so this bottle from Toro piqued our interest when we came across it at Costco for $19.99. We figured it would drink like it cost a bit mor. and that’s exactly what we found. The retail price on this bottle looks to be around $35 but upon Googling around I found a few online outlets selling it for as low as $19. So Costco is towards the bottom of the rang. but certainly not the lowest priced. The wine also received a huge 94 point score from Suckling and 91 points from Wine Spectator. The varietal make up is 100% Tempranillo and although it clocks in with a high 15.5% alcohol leve. it didn’t deter me at all and I didn’t think about it until I looked for the percentage on the bottle after writing my notes. In the glass the wine is a deep rub. very dark; aromas of black cherr. raspberr. pepper and earth; really nice combination of red and dark fruit flavor; black cherr. plu. boysenberr. some herbal notes toward the close. The wine is full bodied with an acidi. dry finish. This is a very tasty wine that leans more on the new school than the old school. Not as rustic and earthy as some of these wines can be.

2015 Covalli Barolo,This bottle is always a welcome site in the Costco wine aisles. If you’ve never read our review. you might be skeptical (as were at first. asking yourself how can a real Barolo be priced at only $14.99. Even the Kirkland Barol. which we really like to. is $20. But I’m happy to sa. and we’ve confirmed it again with this new 2015 vintag. this Covalli Barolo is the real dea. and quite the find at this price. It was a little odd because I actually found this wine in two different places at my Costco. I saw it first in the “cheap seats” (aka the rows of win. not the wooden boxes) and the price was $14.9. no discount; it just looked like the standard price. Then moving into the wooden boxe. I found the price belo. $24.99 with a $10 discount that is good through this weekend. What I’m hoping is that $14.99 just becomes this bottle’s standard price once the discount period is ove. and that looks to be the case given the dual listing. It was $14.99 last year so I bet that will stay the same. Now let’s get into the wine. I couldn’t wait to dig in to confirm if this was a one hit wonder or not. Historically this wine has pulled down 90+ point ratings from the critics. Suckling went 92 on this 2015 vintage. We hit 91 with the last vintage and I was hoping to stay pretty close to that. In the glass the wine pours a pale rub. almost looking like a Pinot Noir. Slight rust just beginning to show around the edges; Rustic nose with black cherry; nice mouthfee. which is what immediately hits you. This wine is so light and sof. and packed with flavor. Mostly red fruit flavo. cherr. raspberr. red licorice; Good dose of acidit. pleasant throughout into a really strong finish. Give it at least 30 minutes to open up.

2017 Quinta do Portal Colheita Douro,If I had to name my number one wine region for high quality red wines at super reasonable prices right no. it would hands down be Portugal. There are a lot of other region. many not too far from her. that still deliver great wines for the mone. but Portugal remains perhaps the one that is least discovered.  But that’s starting to change…and this bottle is a perfect launching off point. This is a blend of Tinta Rori. Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca. That right there might turn away a lot of people who should investigate further.  What are these varietals. Quick reference notes.  Tinta Roriz = Tempranillo.   Touriga Nacional = Portuguese grape that can be likened to Cabernet Sauvignon.  Touriga Franca = Portuguese grape that can be likened to Cabernet Franc. O. now we have an interesting blend.  And this one exceeded my already high expectations. A cool label and Costco’s $11.99 price tag were just icing on the cake. This wine pours a deep dark purple; leathery on the nose with some spicy dark berry fruit; full bodied and big in the mouth; flavors of blueberr. blackberry and plum; nice acidity and more leather notes towards the grippy finish. What a find at Costco.  If this sounds up your alley or you like wines from Duor. I’d stock up as I have a feeling this one is going to get cleaned out pretty fast.  This is a great everyday bottle to have on hand during the colder months. Adding to our Top Picks list. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a Costco Wine Blog Top Pick. Costco item number: 67047.

2018 Di Arie Break Away Zinfandel,Here’s an interesting wine from the Sierra Foothill. an AVA known for its Zinfandel that is located on the Western edge of the Sierra Nevada mountains. There are eight counties within the regio. one of which is Amador which might sound familiar as it’s among the more well known and we’ve seen a few wines from Amador pop up at Costco over the years. This bottle is priced at Costco for $12.99 which is about half of retai. and it turned out to be even better than I expected.  It’s big and heft. and definitely not messing around. This wine pours a medium purple with a spicy nose that is earthy with dark fruit aromas; packed with flavors of blackberr. black cherry with notes of anise and mocha; feels really nice in the mout. medium plus in body. This is big and robust. Acidic into a dry and lingering finish.  There’s lots to like her. and fans of big Cabs or red blends who are hesitant to try a red Zinfandel would absolutely love this wine. . This wine was sent to me by the producer even after I declined their offer because it has a limited distribution in California Costco stores.  So I was under no obligation to post about it.. But after tasting i. I wanted to share with everyone because it’s worth keeping an eye out for even at other stores (I think Total Wine carries it).  And I’m going to add it to our Top Picks list.

2017 Lamadrid Cabernet Franc Reserva,Here’s another interesting Costco wine find – a single vineyard Cabernet Franc from Mendoz. Argentina. This wine also appeared in Wine Enthusiast’s 2019 list of “Top 100 Cellar Selections” (in spot #8. recommendation to drink until 2030) and the outlet rated the wine a nice 92 points. Suckling also went 93 points on it. Retail price on the bottle is listed at $20 making Costco’s $13.89 look pretty solid. I like single vineyard wines as they offer a true sense of time and plac. and that’s exactly what I experienced with this bottle. It pours a deep dark ruby about as dark as it gets; earth. herba. vegetable garden aromas on the nose; full bodie. mouth coasting and big but well made with some finesse that became even more apparent after the wine got some air. Flavors of red and dark frui. black cherr. blackberr. plu. anis. a little smoke in the finish; really nice acidit. dusty and dry into the finish. I don’t have a lot of straight Cab Francs in my cellar so was curious about this bottle appearing on a list of ageable wines. Could it age until 2030 as Wine Enthusiast projects? I’m going to say yes. It has the higher acidity and tannins for the long haul. It’s also drinking pretty nice right now. At this pric. you can buy a couple and maybe stash one away for a later day. 90 points earns it a spot on our Top Picks list. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick.

2011 La Rioja Alta Gran Reserva 904,It’s always a joy to sit down with a glass of this wine. I was so pumped to see this hit Costco shelve. even if the price jumped a bit ($54.99 no. used to be $48.99).  As far as high en. collectible wines g. this is one of the most accessible and delicious wines out ther. in my opinion. I think I can safely say I’ve tasted very vintage of this wine since 2001 (200. 200. 200. 200. 201. 2011).  It’s not made every yea. only the ones deemed worthy enough and they sit on them before release so when they hit stores they are aged a bit and ready to drink.  But still with enough life to run the long haul. I have a bunch of these in my cella. usually trying to buy three at a tim. tasting one and cellaring tw. per my rules.  The 2001 vintage was one of my “ah ha” bottles. The first time I tasted an amazing wine at such an amazing price. That search for high valu. fair cos. has been the nexus for this site. Granted these are not inexpensive wines at all at $54.99. That’s a lot of money for a single bottle of win. but stack this next to most $55 Napa Reds and we’re not even in the same ballpark.  The La Rioja Alta 904 would blow most of these other wines away.  It’s no surprise we’ve seen a little price jump as more people have discovered this one. The wine pours a medium ruby in the glass and looks youn. just a slight rust around the edges. But not much. Aromatic nose with spicy black cherry and anise; in the mouth black cherr. pomegranate and plum flavors; acidic and vibrant throughout with a lingering finish. This vintage is once again absolute dynamite.  Exactly what I hoped for.  I dropped two in my cellar and might consider a couple more if I can swing it.  This is one of those wines that fill a cellar nicely; they can appeal to an average wine drinker who wants to swim upstream as much as a serious wine nerd looking for something special..

2019 Kirkland Signature Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon,We started catching wind that this popular Costco Cab was hitting stores a week or so ago from reader. and I was happy to find it on my last visit. It often hits in the Sept/Oct timeframe so it arrived a little early this year for us. We’ve seen a gentle price creep on this bottle over the years. It originally started at $19.9. and then hit $23.99 last yea. so the first good piece of news is that the price stayed the same with this new 2019 vintage. As I’ve remarked in previous review. this is a ridiculously good price for a bottle of Cabernet from Napa’s Stags Leap region. I don’t think there are any other bottles from this region that even come close. In a quick Google searc. I didn’t find any under $40. Let’s look at our rating history on previous vintages. 2013 90 point. 2014 88 point. 2015 (didn’t review; does anyone have any notes on this vintage?. 2016 89 point. 2017 89 point. 2018 91 point. So really solid rating. culminating in a big 91 points last year. What’s on tap for this new 2019 vintage? Much of the same we experienced last vintag. and that’s a good thing. The wine pours a deep ruby in the glass with earthy aroma. some dark berry; nice and big in the mout. full bodied with grippy tannins; flavors of black cherr. plu. blackberr. anise with some leather towards the finish; a really good lingering finish. Give it 30 minutes (at least) for some air to open it up; it was a little tight for me right out of the bottle. Overal. another “best of” vintage for this Kirkland wine. Taste one and if you agree with m. I’d grab as many of these as your budget can handle. They tend to move pretty fas. and the word is out.  Als. adding to our Top Picks list.

2019 Clos des Lunes Lune d’Argent Bordeaux Blanc,This might not be the first bottle you gravitate to if you’re not familiar with i. or haven’t tasted many white Bordeau. but white wine fans should take note. This is a fantastic wine at a great price. The retail price is around $19.99 and Costco is selling for $13.99; gotta love that. Critic scores range from 91-93 and include all the known names. The more I learned about i. the more I started to feel like everyone else but me seemed to be in the know about this wine. The blend is interesting too. White Bordeaux are comprised of Sauvignon Blan. Semillon and sometimes a little Muscadelle. This blend for this bottle leaned on the Semillo. coming in at 70% Semillon and 30% Sauvignon Blanc. In the glass the wine pours medium to deep gold with aromas white flowers and subtle tropical fruit; flavors of peac. apple and pear; medium in body; super crisp and clean in the dry finish. This a super versatile white wine; really tasty. The back label indicates aging potential and I could see that. It would be fun to try again in a few years. We’re big fans..

2018 Penfolds Bin 28 Kalimna Shiraz,Here’s a fun Costco wine find that we felt drank way above its pay grade. Penfolds is a mega Aussie produce. and they make a lot of great wine. Bin 2. which was first produced in 195. is the earliest of their Bin series. This wine received 90+ points from almost every criti. and after we got into i. it became clear why. This bottle was also listed as #41 on Wine Spectator’s Top 100 of 2020. Retail price is around $35; K&amp;L sells it for $29.99 so Costco’s price is pretty good at $25.99. Lots going for i. so let’s jump into the tasting notes. The wine pours a medium purple in the glass with an aromatic nose of ripe berrie. spic. and a little vanilla; it is medium plus to full in body; big in the mout. nice concentration; flavors of dark frui. blackberr. plum with some mocha; spic. earthy into a finish that lingers for a while. We thought this was a beautiful wine: interestin. bi. spicy and dying to be paired with a juicy steak. It was tasty in its yout. but could definitely lay down for a few more years. At $26 this isn’t an inexpensive wine. But you’d be hard pressed to find many bottles priced the same that could match its quality.

2018 Duckhorn Chardonnay Napa Valley,Over the year. we’ve reviewed quite a few Duckhorn and Decoy (by Duckhorn) wines that have appeared at Costco and they’ve consistently delivered. Most recentl. we posted about the Decoy Sonoma Red that we thought was a really good buy. Duckhorn’s whites have proven to be delicious as well. Their Sauvignon Blanc pops up occasionall. and is another good pick. This Chardonnay proved interestin. arriving at Costco for $26.4. which is pretty good considering Wine.com is selling it for $38. Suckling gave it 93 points too. The wine pours a medium gold in glass with a nose of citrus frui. orange peel and just a hint of oak; it is medium plus in bod. feels great in the mouth; flavors of lemo. green appl. peach and a little orange liqueur in the finish; light on the oak so the fruit really comes through.

2019 Jax Y3 Chardonnay,We first tasted the Jax Y3 Chardonnay a year ago after finding the 2016 vintage at Costco. I’d heard a few readers buzzing about i. the wine was highly rate. and Costco’s price was great at $13.99. Turned ou. we loved the wine. Now the 2019 vintage is making its way into stores. You’ll notice a label change; the old one has dots throughout the front labe. while the newer one is a cleaner look. The price stayed the same at $13.99 which is great (retail around $22. and this vintage has continued to receive critic accolades including 91 points from Wine Enthusiast. The fruit for this wine comes from a single vineyard in Carneros. What I love about i. in this vintage just like past one. is how the fruit comes through. There’s just a kiss of oa. no butte. just clean Chablis-style citrus fruit. In the glas. it pours a medium gol. and that citrus fruit begins on the nose; flavors are aprico. lemo. pear and apple; just super clean throughou. well made; great into the lasting finish; crisp and delicious.

2018 San Simeon Pinot Noir Monterey,We’ve had some fun tasting through a few of the Pinot Noirs at Costco right now that are priced under $20. We tasted the Cloudline (Willamette) and Rodney Strong (Russian River. enjoyed both and went 88 points on each one. Let’s move to another area known for amazing Pinot Noi. Monterey county and the sustainable vineyards from San Simeon. The name might be familiar as we tasted and reviewed their Paso Robles Viognier earlier this year. We enjoyed that one quite a bit so had high hopes for this Pinot…and they delivered. This is a bi. spicy and racy Pinot Noir. Definitely a little more heft than the other Pinots we’ve tasted. It pours a medium ruby in glass with an aromatic nose that’s floral and spicy; medium in bod. leaning toward medium plus; big flavors of black cherr. cola and raspberry; some mild leather and mocha notes; lingering finish with some spice. Costco’s price of $19.99 is pretty much on par with what you will find this wine selling for elsewher. including Total Wine. So it’s more of a wine to remember for whenever you see it vs one that you need to seek out at Costco right now because of the great price. We’ll be adding to our Top Picks list for sure.

2018 Provenance Sauvignon Blanc Rutherford,Here’s a Sauvignon Blanc I’ve always been curious about. Key word on the label is “Rutherford” which fans of the Kirkland Rutherford Cabernet will be familiar with. It’s one of the top regions within Napa Valle. and a personal favorite. Provenance makes a delicious Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon that we’ve tasted and enjoyed; that one is priced in the mid $50s. This Sauvignon Blanc primarily comes from their estate vineyards in Rutherfor. although a small percentage of the grapes come from nearby regions. I did a little poking around and found that the wine is almost all Sauvignon Blanc (97.5%) but includes 2% Semillon and .5% Muscat; a little Bordeaux blanc influence. Costco’s price is right on at $15.99. I found the same bottle for $24 at Wine.com and the retail price on the Provenance website is $25. We also have some high critic scores; 90 points from Wine Enthusiast and 91 from Suckling. On this bottl. I completely agree with them. It’s delicious. The wine pours a pale to medium yellow in the glass with a citrusy nose; it is medium plus in body with flavors of green appl. lemo. and pineapple; the wine has a nice sour bite to it and a just touch of oak in the finish. Overal. this one is super crisp and a great summer wine choice. The fruit really shines throug. plenty of body and then the hint of oak in the finish makes for a nicely balanced wine that is complex and interesting with every drink. A great choice for all types of white wine fans. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 17949. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. GA (Kennesaw).

2020 Kirkland Signature Cotes De Provence Rosé,Here’s a Kirkland bottle we’ve been waiting to arriv. especially as the weather warms up.  I know a few readers have spotted it recentl. so it should be making its way through stores nationwide right now. This is likely the fastest moving Costco wine that we track.  If you spot i. buy it.  While I was waiting to grab my allotment of the win. two ladies in front of me were working on getting two cases of it to fit in their cart. One of them turned to me and said what a fantastic wine it is for the money.  I agreed. Then I looked up and saw the price on the Costco placard and couldn’t believe it.  $8.69.  Now I know we’re not talking huge sums of money her. but last year the price rose to $9.9. which is what I expecte. and hoped this new 2020 vintage would be. But somehow it’s gone all the way down to the same price we saw on the 2016 vintage.  A nice little bonu. and just a really great price on high quality Cotes de Provence Rosé. The blend this year is 35% Grenach. 28% Cinsaul. 11% Carigna. 9% Syra. 7% Tiboure. 4% Ugni Blan. 4% Vermentino and 2% Mourvedre.  It’s worth noting this is a little different than the past few years that were heavier on Grenache and didn’t include the Vermentino or Mourvedre.  But I like this year’s blend a lot. Here’s a brief look at our ratings for this wine since it was released in the 2016 vintage. 2016 90 point. 2017 90 point. 2018 89 point. 2019 89 point. So it’s been a consistent winne. and that will only continue. Let’s get into the tasting.  The wine pours a pale salmon in the glass with red berry on the nose; lots of strawberry with some orang. citrus and white peach flavors; super crisp with nice acidity and minerality throughout.  Really a lovely wine all around. The more of this wine I tasted the more I found to like.  Just as the price bounced back to 2016 vintage level.

2016 Famiglia Castellani Chianti Classico Reserva,It seems like people around the wine world are talking a lot about Chianti Classico at the moment. I know one of my favorite wine writer. Eric Asimov from the NY Time. is a huge fan of them right now. We’ve always enjoyed them as wel. finding a lot of quality at great price. so figured it was worth tasting this 2016 vintage bottle that appeared at our Costco. It comes the Castellani Famil. which has produced wine in Tuscany for more than 150 years. The price was $13.99 at Costco which is pretty good. Retail seems to be around $2. and online you can score the bottle for a few bucks less than that. And there’s a nice big Suckling 93 point score on the placard. 2016 was an excellent year for Italian wine so I was a little surprised to see one still lingering around. And it wa. as I hope. drinking perfectly right now with a little age starting to form.

Veuve Clicquot Brut Champagne Yellow Label,As we’ve been drinking more Champagn. I’ve been wanting to buy a bottle of Veuve Clicquot to see how it stacks up.  I’ve had a few bottles over the years and have always enjoyed them. . This Champagne is widely available and almost always in stoc. at least in the stores around the Atlanta area.  We are big fans of the Kirkland Champagne that can be scored for $2. so the question becomes how big is the jump in quality to justify not buying a two pack of Kirkland Champagne for a few bucks less. Costco’s price on Veuve Clicquot is $48.99 which I’d like to see a bit lower (I know it used to be $46 at Costco).  It’s fairly easy to find this bottle for that price elsewher. including Total Wine that matches Costco’s price.  So this is one of those semi-rare instances where we’re not getting any price advantage buying the bottle at Costc. which is a bummer. The wine howeve. is delicious and perhaps a bit better than I expected.  It really is a perfectly balanced sparkling wine that is cris. flavorfu. interestin. complex and hard to put down.. This wine is a medium gold in glass with citrus fruit on the nose; flavors of lemo. pear and green apple with a touch of macadamia nut; it is medium in body with a gentle effervescence; ultra dry in the finish.  Really a beautiful Champagne. This is certainly not an everyday bottle given it’s price poin. but should be a contender for those special occasions when you want something really nice..

2018 Willamette Valley Vineyards Dijon Clone Chardonnay,There’s an interesting story behind this wine as evidenced by the clue in its name “Dijon Clone.. Willamette Valley Vineyards founder Jim Bernau travelled to Burgundy France in the 80’s and brought back these vines for use in Oregon vineyards where he expected they might also thrive. And based on my tasting on this bottl. thrive is definitely the right word. I wasn’t sure what to expect but this turned out to be a delicious blend of the old and new worlds of wine. Super pure and clea. just the style of Chardonnay that I enjoy the most as long-time readers will know. The wine pours a medium gold in the glass; lemony citrus fruit with a hint of vanilla on the nose; in the glass is more lemo. apple and apricot flavors; super clean fruit that shines through with nice acidity. Juicy and minerally in the finish. This one is definitely on more of the clean frui. pure side of Chardonnays vs the overly oaky and buttery.The wine has plenty of depth and complexity to remain interestin. and it is certainly food friendly as well. Retail price is around $25 so Costco’s price of $15.99 makes this a fantastic buy. I’m going to put this on our Top Picks list as it’s one of the better Chardonnays from Costco that I’ve tasted recently in this price range.

2018 Kirkland Signature Suscol Vineyard Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,I was so happy to finally find this bottle last night.  There’s been a lot of discussion among readers nationwide who saw this one arrive in their stores before it made it’s way here.  The feedback has been extremely positive and I was curious what Costco could pack into a single vineyard Napa Cab for $17. Suscol Vineyard was of particular interest to me because I knew Nickel and Nickel created wines from ther. and pretty much anything they touch is gold.  Cakebread makes wines from there too and both will run 3-4X times the price of this Kirkland bottle. Plus we just reviewed the standard Kirkland Napa Cabernet which is available for $15. We thought that wine was pretty good and went 88 points.  But the question is whether it’s worth $2 more for the Suscol? The answer is a resounding ye. in our opinion. The wine pours a deep ruby in the glass with lots of spic. earth and dark berry on the nose; in the mouth is mostly dark frui. blackberr. blueberry and plum with notes of dark chocolate; the wine is spicy into the finish with dry acidity. . This is a very nice wine with ripe fruit that is still very young; popping it in the decanter isn’t a bad idea if you’re drinking it now but it will fun to lay a few of these down and see how they develop.. 2018 was a great vintage for Napa and this wine has all the pieces of a great wine.  We bought thre. drank on. and plan to cellar the other two for a bi. and will report back on their progress in the future.

Langlois Chateau Cremant de Loire Brut,We drink a fair amount of bubbly wine at our house. It just goes with anythin. any mea. anybody. Long time readers know that we love the Kirkland Champagne for $19.99. That’s real French Champagne at an almost unheard of price. We were excited to see another French bubbly hit our Costco store. this time from the Loire Valle. of which we are also big fans. The price was right at $15.9. compared to a retail price closer to $23. I always gravitate toward these French Cremants when looking for values in sparkling wine. Prosecco can be nice from time to tim. but can also get a little bland and boring after a while. French Cremants are a few bucks mor. but typically bring a nice bump in quality. I particularly like the ones from Loire. This wine is an interesting blend (very Loire) of Chenin (60%. Cabernet Franc (20%) and Chardonnay (20%). A fun fact I discovered is that Langlois Chateau is owned by Bollinger of Champagne fame. Wine Enthusiast also gave the bottle 90 points. The wine pours a pale yellow to straw in the glass with a little mineral and citrus fruit on the nose; mostly pea. sour green appl. with a little white peach flavor. Delicate in the mout. nice effervescence. Finishes cris. a super solid bubbly for the price. We are going to match the 90 point that we gave the Kirkland Champagne on our last tasting of it.

When we last reviewed the 2012 vintage that we purchased at Costco for $2. we found it to be really good value. Retail price on this wine seems to be around $24-$25. The good news on this 2017 vintage in stores now is that the price was down to $16.9. which totally caught me by surprise. What a deal for this bottle. Plu. Wine Enthusiast gave the wine a huge 94-point rating and listed it as an Editor’s Choice. Let’s get into what’s inside. This wine is from Santa Maria Valley in Santa Barbara Count. and proudly states the certified sustainable farming designation on the front of the label. The color is a pale rub. very much on the pale side. It pours light but that’s not an indicator for what’s coming. It’s the nose that gets you right away. The aromas are super vibrant; fresh berrie. spice and earth. Nice depth in the mouth with cherr. col. strawberry flavors; toasty in the finish with a nice peppery spice and a little vanilla. Excellent win. and an amazing value. So now the question i. how does this stack up to the other Pinots in Costco right now that we’ve reviewed. Wel. we’re going 90 points on this on. which is the same as the recently reviewed Kirkland Willamette Pinot although these are two different wines. This Cambria bottle is ideal for fans of a more traditional Pinot. The Willamette bottle is a Pinot ideal for fans of bigger red wines. Both great bottle. just a little different. I enjoyed them both a little more than the latest Kirkland Russian River Pinot but still hold the Balletto Pinot Noir as the one to bea. albeit slightly upstream in pric. but what a delicious wine. Regardless of the nuance. every wine I just listed is a solid be. this Cambria being among the top of the pack. Explore and let us know what you like the best.

2018 Kirkland Signature Willamette Valley Pinot Noir,It’s nice to see this Kirkland Pinot return to store shelves in the latest 2018 vintage. This bottle is a reader and personal favorite among the Kirkland wine portfolio. There are a few important things to note that are carried over from the prior 2017 vintage. First is the price which has stayed the same at $14.9. which we think it totally fair for a wine of this caliber. Next is the winemake. Sarah Cabo. who also made the previous vintage. Here’s a story we found with a little more info about her. Given how much we enjoyed the 2017 vintag. when we saw her name on the back of the 201. we figured we were in for more of the same. And that turned out to be the case. My tasting notes are very similar to the prior vintag. but in the en. I ended up enjoying this bottle a little more. It’s a great Pinot buy for $15. This wine pours a pale to medium ruby with juicy cherry on the nose; more cherr. and cola flavor in the mout. with a touch of Dr Peppe. some boysenberr. little spic. a little oak. The fruit is really vibrant and youthful and the wine is very pleasant throughout. Clean through the finish. Just well made. We went 89 points on the last vintage but I’m bumping this up to 90 with this new 2018 vintage. I much prefer this to the current vintage of the Kirkland Russian River Pinot and it’s perhaps a slight notch up from the Carneros Pinot that we also really enjoyed recently. Of the Kirkland Pinots out there right no. I think that this is the one to buy. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 97527.

2016 Kirkland Signature Barolo,We heard from readers a week ago that the 2016 vintage of the Kirkland Barolo was showing up in store. and that was music to our ears. The 2015 vintag. which came out exactly a year ag. was the inaugural vintage of this new Kirkland win. and we welcomed it with open arms. The price then was $19.99 and the wine was deliciou. earning an easy 92 point rating from us. I think this is one of those rare instances where our scores align with wine pro James Sucklin. who according to the Costco placar. awarded both the 2015 and 2016 vintage 92 points. The first question with the arrival of the new vintage was whether the price would increase. Happil. it did no. staying strong at $19.99 which is a steal for a Barolo of this caliber. I wrote this year’s tasting notes without reviewing my notes on the ’1. and they turned out almost identical. Both ’15 and ’16 were strong vintages for Barol. and both bottles are an excellent expression of them. If you enjoyed the previous vintag. I imagine you will love this one as well. This wine pours a pale garnet in the glas. lightly see through; juicy cherry on nose with flavors of earthy black cherry in the mouth along with notes of anise; some toast and vanilla into the finish. The wine is medium plus to full in bod. and finishes dust. dry and lingering. The first word that came to mind after I finished my first glass was “exquisite.” This is a really an excellent wine and amazing at this price. There’s good aging potential here too so I might try to pop one in the cellar for a Cellar Series write up down the line. I think it will be interesting to taste again in 5-10 years. My rating is staying the same at 92 point. and obviously this will appear on our Top Picks list. You might want to scoop up a few of these while you have the chanc. as they might move pretty fast.

2018 Oberon Cabernet Sauvignon,Finding good quality Napa Cabernet under $20 is always a challenge. It’s out ther. but there are a lot of mediocre offerings spread among the good one. so it’s a constant hunt. Costco’s Kirkland Cabs are usually a goo. safe entry point. Oberon is one of those names you should put on your radar too. In addition to this Napa County Caberne. they make excellent Merlot and Sauvignon Blanc. Costco’s price on the Cab was $19.69 which is goo. not grea. considering retail is around $2. and online it’s $21-$22. Note we said Napa County in the preceding paragrap. not Napa Valley. Napa County means the grapes were sourced from all over Napa Count. not just the Napa Valley designated AVA. It’s just something to not. and there are so many great vineyards all around Napa Count. not just in Napa Valley. Napa Valley just has the cachet of that specific AVA. It’s evident from the moment you taste this one that this is high quality juice regardless of where in the County the grapes came from. Something else to note is that this wine is actually a blend of 92.7% Cabernet Sauvignon and then 7.3% of Petite Verdot and Zinfandel. I didn’t realize that until after I had tasted i. and the blending varietals weren’t super noticeable to m. perhaps just contributing to the overall depth that I found impressive for this wine at this price. It pours a deep ruby to deep purple in the glass with wild berry and spice on the nose; the wine is nice and full in body with a contrast of red and dark frui. cherr. raspberr. along with blackberry; hints of dark chocolate and mocha; dry into the finish. This is a great buy for CA Cab fans and exactly what I was hoping this wine would be. I’d probably still opt for the Kirkland Oakville or Kirkland Stags (ye. the Stags is still around; spotted it last weekend) for around the same pric. but all of these are right there in the same ballpark.

2013 Casa de Santar Reserva Red Blend Portugal,There are a lot of places throughout Europe to find good red wine values. A few of my go to’s are Rioja/Ribera/Toro in Spai. Chianti/Barbera in Ital. Rhone/Cru Beaujolais in France. And Portuguese wines definitely fit the bill. They consistently overdeliver at very reasonable price points. The challenge is that they just aren’t prevalent enough. My Total Wine store carries just a handful (mainly whites and a small selection of red. but that’s starting to slowly increase). In all the years of running this sit. we only occasionally find red wines from Portugal at Costco (2-3 a year it seems). So this was an easy drop in the cart; a Portuguese red blend for $13.9. with a little age on it. The bottle has a nice card around its neck showing off all the high scores the wine receive. including a 92 from Wine Enthusiast who named it a “Cellar Selection.. The blend here is 50% Touriga-Naciona. 25% Aragone. and 25% Alfrocheiro. I knew Touriga-Naciona. which is one of the most popular red varietals for Portugal but had to do a little research on the others. Aragonez is also called Tinta Roriz and is actually the same grape as Tempranillo. Alfrocheiro (Preto. also known as Tinta Bastardinh. is a deep colored grape frequently used in blends. And some of that deep color was evident on the pour where the wine showed a medium to deep purple color; nose of spicy black cherry; this is a big and full bodied wine; flavors of mostly dark frui. boysenberry and blueberry with dark chocolate notes; nice acidit. dry into a finish that last forever. This is a very nice wine that we liked immediately out of the bottle but one that got even better as it decanted. Try to let it breath 30-60 minutes before drinking it if you can. Overal. a solid Costco wine pick and a great representation of the immense value you can find in Portuguese wines today. This will be added to our Top Picks list.

2017 Joseph Phelps Freestone Pinot Noir Sonoma,Joseph Phelps is one of my top ten wine producers from Californi. and it is a nice surprise to see their Freestone Pinor Noir from the Sonoma Coast hit Costco shelves. You’ve probably seen their high-end red blen. the Joseph Phelps Insigni. hanging around stores too for $20. which is a very good price on one of Napa’s top bottlings. This Pinot Noir is also not an inexpensive wine at Costco for $33.9. but that is a huge discount considering retail price is $6. and online it is around $5. even at K&amp;L Wines who is always among the most competitive online. This wine pours a pale ruby in the glass with grape jam on the nose; nice mouthfee. medium in bod. this wine is just classy all around. Flavors of cherry and blueberry with lingering dark chocolate notes and a little spice. Wraps up with a perfec. lasting finish. This bottle is pure elegance in Pinot Noir and I just couldn’t get enough. It also scored big with the mainstream wine critic. including receiving a huge 96 points from Wine Enthusiast. If your wine budget allows you to extend to the $30 price rang. this is a perfect pic. and nice choice for a special dinner or occasion. Costco did a great job bringing this one to us for almost half of retail. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 93 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 39468. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant.

2019 Kirkland Signature Sancerre,It’s always exciting when there’s a new addition to the Kirkland Signature portfolio of wine. and we’ve seen a few good ones over the past 12 months. There was the new K Vine Kirkland wines (Chardonnay and Rosé) from Charles Smit. and the Kirkland Barolo that come to mind. This Sancerre is definitely on the list of winners to. and I hope we see this one in regular rotation in future vintages. Sancerre is a wine region in the Loire Valley of central France where the white wines from are made from Sauvignon Blanc. So like most French bottle. the label specifies the region not the varieta. and sometime. as is the case her. you get a bit more information on the back label.. French wine is always a study in geography. A lot of the Sancerre wines you see are priced between $20-$3. so I think Costco brought this one in at the right price point of $15.99. This was confirmed once we started tasting it too as this proved to be a very nice expression of Sauvignon Blanc. The wine poured a medium straw in colo. pretty light in the glass; fairly muted on the nose with subtle hints of orange peel and citrus fruit; in the mouth though is where the wine really started to shine with nice citrus fruit flavo. aprico. lemo. a little grapefruit; nice acidity and minerality with a touch of vanilla into the finish. This bottle is a very welcome addition to the Kirkland wine famil. and we’re excited to see what future vintages might deliver. Since it’s early Marc. it’s unlikely these are going to be hanging around stores when the weather warms u. so I’m planning on buying a few to hold on to for the summer months.

2016 Les Allies Chateauneuf-du-Pape,I know there are a lot of you Chateauneuf fans out there who are like me and are waiting for the next vintage (2019) of the Kirkland Chateauneuf to arrive in stores. I’m projecting that we will see it in the May-June timefram. if past history is any indication. That bottle is always interesting in that the super reasonable $20 price tag ($21 last year) provides access to this famed area of Rhone for less than almost anywhere else. So while we’re waiting for that on. I thought it be fun to taste test this $30 Chateaneuf that I’d never had before. $30 for a Chateauneuf is still a good deal if the wine inside is tasty. I noticed the 91 points on the Costco placard from Wine Spectator and was curious how it would hold up. This wine is 65% Grenach. 20% Mourvèdre and 15% Syrah from what I could gather online. I found a retail price of $45 but then the more I clicked around the better it got onlin. with some stores selling it for as low as $2. which surprised me. The wine pours kind of a deep garne. and it looks older in the glass with a little rust color starting to develop around the edges. 2016 was an excellent vintage so I was anxious to see how it was drinking right now. Signature Chateaneuf-du-Pape on the nose; earth. herba. wild berry. In the mouth flavors of plu. pomegranat. black licorice and black cherry; it’s acidic and dry in the finish which sticks around forever. This is a very nice wine at a pretty attractive price. I get skeptical when bottles from premier regions are priced too lo. but this one came through. This recent Costco Barolo did too. There’s lots to like here for Rhone fan. and this wine is drinking really nice right now. You of course can lay these bottles down for a while too if you prefer. It’s likely to develop even more in the next 5-7 years. We’ll be putting this one for sure on our Top Picks list. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a Costco Wine Blog Top Pick.

2018 Ridge Three Valleys Sonoma Red Wine,Ridge is hands down one of my favorite U.S. wine producers so when I see one of their distinct labels hit Costco shelve. it’s like finding a treasure for me. And this bottle especially because it is a wine from Ridge that I’ve never tasted befor. and Costco’s price was right on the mark. Finding anything from Ridge for $20 is a score. Their Zins are in the $30s and up. Most of their other wines are more expensive than that. This wine came in at $19.99 at my Costco. It’s $24-29 online and $30 at Total Wine. Ridge is known for their amazing Zin portfoli. and this Sonoma red blend is led by Zinfandel. The varietal breakdown is 70% Zinfande. 14% Petite Sira. 12% Carignane and 4% Mataro. For Zin fan. this is a no brainer but fans of red blends should take note too. While this wine exudes Zin characteristic. it is also masterfully blended to create a very accessibl. very enjoyable red wine that I think will appeal to a lot of palates and could pair with many different types of food. This wine pours a medium ruby with a little purple; it has an aromatic nose of flower. spice and plum. It is delightful in the mouth with silky tannin. medium in body; flavors of black cherr. blueberr. blackberr. and a little jam; there’s a touch of oak on the toasty finish. This wine is well mad. well balance. and just what I hoped for from Ridge in a Sonoma blend. They are just so consistent. Although their wines are not inexpensiv. they always deliver high quality for the pric. at least in my opinion. I’d encourage readers to look for their Estate Ca. Chardonna. and of cours. any of their Zins. If you want to really go nut. the Ridge Monte Bello ($250. from the Santa Cruz mountain. is one of the most unique and beautiful California Cabs out there. But to finish up on this blen. this is a great price on a really impressive win. and one that will earn a spot on our Top Picks list. Nice job Costco bringing this bottle in.

2018 Duckhorn Decoy Sonoma Red Wine,These are always fun wines to try so I was looking forward to popping open this Decoy Red from Sonoma. Deco. as many of you kno. is a second win. turned second bran. of Duckhorn Vineyards and they are priced well below those “first” wines that carry the Duckhorn name. We’ve reviewed several of the past vintages of this win. with scores getting increasingly better. The 2013 we went 88 points; for the 2014 we went 89 point. and now we’re up to 2018 and we’re going to keep the progression going as I felt this wine was worthy of breaking into that 90 point threshold. Before we get into the win. let’s look at the pric. which has stayed fairly consistent at Costco at $16.99. It went up a hair with the 2014 vintage and is now back at 2013 prices. On the Decoy sit. the retail is $25. It’s $17 at my Total Win. matching Costco. And online it ranges from $15-$20. It seems like Costco could offer this at a little bit more of a discounted price to beat the big box stores. Looking at what’s inside the bottl. there’s not a varietal breakdown listed on the label but online I was able to find it: 52% Cabernet Sauvigno. 37% Merlo. 6% Petite Sira. 2% Zinfande. 2% Carignan and 1% Syrah. In the glass this wine pours a medium purpl. with a floral nose with wild berry aromas; big cherry flavor with raspberry and pomegranate; red licoric. more Nibs vs Twizzler. with a touch of vanilla into finish. This is a youthfu. vibrant wine that is nice and pleasant throughout.If you like red blends from Californi. this is a nice representation of the quality you can get when you spend $15-$20 vs under $10. We will add to our Top Picks as this might be the best vintage of this wine that we’ve reviewed. Even though we’d like to see a slightly lower Costco pric. it’s absolutely worth buying at $17.

2019 Finca Sophenia Altosur Malbec,I always love trying new Malbecs that pop up at Costco and this one turned out to be quite a find. The price was right at only $7.89. Online it looks like the retail price of this wine hovers around $10-1. so Costco is offering the bottle at a decent discount. It certainly tasted like it cost more. This wine is a medium purple in colo. with a nose of wild berry and some mineral. Cherry flavor in the mouth with a bit of blackberry and plum; there’s a nice red/dark fruit contrast that I always like. It is medium to medium plus in bod. delicate and light in the mouth with a nice sticky finish. Overal. a very elegant and well balanced expression of Malbec that is surprising to find at a such a reasonable price. You’ll note on the Costco placard sign that the wine received 92 points from Sucklin. and 93 points on the previous vintage. Online I found a few other ratings that were in the 89-90 point rang. which is about where I feel it belongs. This bottle is really a good value for only $7.89 and Mendoza Malbec fans should stock up as I think they will find a lot to like. I could easily have spent $20 on this same wine and been happy.

2016 Pagodes de Cos St Estephe Bordeaux,I love it when Costco carries these second wines from top estates. In this cas. we’re tasting the second bottle from Chateau Cos d’Estourne. whose main estate grand vin is $200-$250. So accessing this world class property for under $50 is a pretty good way to go. I still would like to see Costco’s price of $48.99 get more competitive though. This same bottl. same vintag. is available at Total Wine for the same price and online for about the same as wel. both within that $47-$49 range. Knowing thi. I almost hesitated buying i. but I love this estate (even had the privilege of visiting the winery a year and half ago) and thought this would be a fun one to add to the site. The blend is 50% Cabernet Sauvigno. 46.5% Merlo. 3% Petit Verdot and 0.5% Cabernet Franc. Very precise on the Merlot and Cab Franc. It’s also highly rated pretty much across all the critics with Suckling going 94 points and Wine Enthusiast giving it 93 points. Wine Advocate and others are all in the 91-93 range too. The wine pours a deep purple in the glass with an aromatic nose of raspberry and plu. a little barnyard; then more black cherry and dark fruit flavor in the mouth; medium plus to full in body. Amazing lasting finish that just digs in and won’t let go; a memorable wine in every way. As far as Bordeaux goes in this price rang. this drinks at the top of the class and not far off from other estate’s first bottles. 2016 was an excellent year to. and this bottle really is a gift of the vintage from a top tier estate at a pric. that is not inexpensive of cours. but more than fair for what you get. Note that Cos d’Estournel’s first wine in this same 2016 vintage received 100 point scores almost across the board. I’m a huge fan of this second bottle at this price point. Highly recommen. and it’s a must buy for Bordeaux lovers. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 93 points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick. Costco item number: 130870. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. GA (Perimeter).

2016 Jim Barry Lodge Hill Shiraz,I was really excited to find this wine at Costco as I’ve tasted it several times before in previous vintage. and have always loved it. You can’t beat a favorite like this showing up at Costc. and of course the price was right at only $13.89. The retail price on the wine is closer to $20 and you can find it online a few bucks cheaper than tha. but I’ve never seen it at Costco’s price anywhere else. If yo. like m. have tasted this one befor. stock up while you can because someone in the know is going to see this and buy these up fast. This wine is super consistent year to yea. always overdelivering and always providing a delicious and elegant expression of Aussie Shiraz. Add on top of that the wine is a 2016 vintage that is drinking perfectly right no. and you’re ready to unscrew this one and put it down the hatch. The wine pours a medium to deep purple in the glass with fresh red fruit and a little spice on the nose. The wine is medium in body in the mouth with juicy red frui. licorice and plum flavor; showing a nice contrast between red and dark fruit which I always like. It is acidic and dry into the finish with more peppery spice. Elegance is the key word here. This is not an over the top bold spicy Shira. as some of these Aussie bottles can be. It’s a versatile food win. it’s highly rated (even pulling down 93 points from James Suckling) and one where I really enjoyed every sip.

2014 Covalli Barolo,Earlier this year we saw the introduction of a Kirkland Signature Barolo for $20 that we loved.  Who would guess that a few months late. Costco would stock another Barolo priced even lower than that. Barolo wines just don’t get priced this low so I was a little skeptical going i. but also excited at the prospect that this might be a great find.  Suckling gave the wine 91 points.  Retail price looks to be about $30 and it’s available online for $25.  So Costco’s price is really good. This is a 2014 vintage (the Kirkland Barolo was 2015. and this wine is ready to drink now; all the aging is done for you.  My tasting notes are super similar to the Kirkland Barol. and in the end I’m going to say they are both right in the same ballpark in terms of quality. This wine pours a medium garnet in the glass showing it’s got a little age on it; nose of liqueur and black licorice.  I love how Barolos feel in the mout. lighter in body but with massive flavor. Big spicy cherry flavor.Acidic and dry into the finish. The spice really sticks around. What a find for $15.

2018 Kirkland Signature Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon,It’s nice to see this one back on Costco shelves.  It was hinted at being out there in a recent Wall Street Journal article about Costco Wine (here it i. subscription required).   So that sent me into my Costco on the lookout. Kirkland’s Rutherford offerings used to be just a Meritage blen. which we enjoyed (rating around 88 points. but then almost two years ag. we got a straight Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon from Kirkland in the 2016 vintage. Our contributor Eri. liked this win. scoring it 89 points. It looks like we might have skipped a 2017 vintag. as indicated both by our inability to find on. and the Costco placard sign you see here which appears to skip it as well. . And the price seems to have gone up $. from $17.99 for the 2016 to $18.99 for the 2018.  But it turns out to be more than worth it. For this new 2018 vintage we once again have Glenn Hugo as the winemake. and he has been at the helm of many other NapaKirkland winesthat we’ve reviewed. I was immediately impressed with this wine from the moment we popped the cork. Juic. floral aromas; the wine pours a deep ruby in color and is medium plus to full in body. . Flavors of black cherry and blueberry with dark chocolate and a touch of vanilla; chalky in the finish as these wines tend to be. Just a beautiful package all around that we couldn’t get enough of.  This bottle could easily pass as having cost two to three times as much.  This is high quality Napa juice under $20 that you just won’t find anywhere else.

The Valdelacierva bottle is $14.99; the La Gitana was $11.99. Retail on these wines are $30 and $50 respectivel. from what I found online. Both wines earned big scores from Wine Enthusias. the Valdelacierva receiving 91 points and the La Gitana receiving a whopping 94 points (maybe a bit on the high side). From those stat. it appears you should go for the slightly lower priced La Gitan. but let’s get into the taste profile a bit more and I’ll point out the primary difference that we noticed. The Valdelacierva Rioja pours a pale to medium rub. definitely lighter in the glass than the La Gitana which was a deeper ruby. There’s perfume and dried fruit on the nos. then black cherry frui. anis. pepper and mocha notes leading into the finish. The wine is medium bodied and really developed nicely as it got more air; it is acidic and dry into the very lasting finish. Comparing notes between the two Rioj. the La Gitana had a touch of candy sweetness on the finis. while the Valdelacierva was more acidic and dry. For m. I prefer the latter style if I had to choos. but overal. I loved both of these wines and will score them equally at 90 point. along with adding them to our Top Picks list. I don’t think you can go wrong with either one. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick. Costco item number: 136954. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. GA (Woodstock.

2014 Kirkland Signature Ribera del Duero Gran Reserva,It’s nice walking down the aisle and catching a glimpse of those signature blue and silver rings that grace the neck of the Kirkland Ribera del Duero. . This is still a young addition in the Kirkland wine famil. and it can prove to be fairly elusive to. as demonstrated by the fact that we either missed or couldn’t find the previous 2013 vintage of this wine.  If anyone has a ’13 or tasted a ’1. please share in the comments below. We’ve reviewed the 2011 and the 2012 vintage. scoring them both 90 points.  And then the 2011 again as part of a Cellar Series.  I found this new 2014 vintage to be right there with previous one. and this remains a tremendous value for $13.99. The key to these wines is the decant.  I’ve mention this in our reviews of previous vintage. but given these wine have a little bit of age on the. they really open up after a good 45 minute decant. . If you don’t have a decante. or don’t want to clean one (because they’re a pain in the butt. you can also just grab a couple extra glasses and distribute the wine across them. This one pours a medium ruby in the glass with dried cherry on the nose; nice black cherry and black fruit once you get into it; solid in the finish with a touch of oa. and a little spice.  A really elegant and well made wine all around. At $1. I think this is once again a stea. and validation for having a Costco membershi. to gain access to deals like this.  Grab a couple to have on hand during the holidays. . This wine is versatile enough to pair with about any foo. and any compan. and is likely to please newbies and wine snobs alike.

2015 La Gitana Gold Rioja,This is the best $12 bottle of wine I’ve had in some time. I almost didn’t buy this because the label just looked a little suspect. I’m not sure why (and it looks better in the picture below. it just came off to me visually as a cheap bottle. But this initial perception was way off base. Clearly an example of not judging a wine by its label. What’s even more surprising is that the retail price on this bottle turned out to be $50 from what I found on Wine Enthusias. a fact I didn’t find out until after I was done writing up my notes on it. Now it all makes sense. This is a higher end wine wrapped up in an inexpensive packag. exactly what this blog is all about uncovering for readers. Also in the Wine Enthusiast write up you’ll note the 94 points they awarded the win. which is pretty insane for a wine you can buy for $12 at Costco. Decanter backed it up with a 92 point rating. Both a little high in my opinio. but nice to see the kudos. By the wa. if you want to get past the Wine Enthusiast pay wall that seems to have just gone u. just load the page and then hit Ctrl-. or select all. This will actually copy all the text behind the pay wall. Then just open up a blank word document and paste it in. It won’t be pretty but all the details on the wine will be towards the top of the page. Here’s that link if you want to try it. The wine pours a deep ruby in color with dried cherries on the nose; spicy black cherry in the mouth with a touch of mocha; candied finish. This wine is drinking great right now. This one really caught me off guard. I love Rioj. and was impressed from the very first sip. This is definitely an addition to our Top Picks list. Red wine fans should stock up for the winter months as you just don’t find many wines this good priced this low. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick.

2017 Smith &amp; Hook Proprietary Red Blend,Smith &amp; Hook is one of those dependable names you love to see on a bottle of wine.  Kind of like Seghesi. Ridge or Mayacamas (first three that came to mind. I just can’t think of the last time I tasted a wine from Smith &amp; Hook that I didn’t enjoy. So finding the latest vintage of their red blend at Costco was a real treat.  Granted the $15.99 price tag leaves a little to be desired.  Retail on the wine is $2. but this same bottle is available at Total Wine for the same $15.99 price ta. and onlin. even less at a few places.  $12-$14 at Costco would be great.  And the price is the only gripe I have with this one. The blend here is Merlo. Malbe. Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvigno. sourced from a variety of vineyards around the Central Coast area.  Usually I don’t like these so called kitchen sink blend. but Smith &amp; Hook always seem to know how to do i. and they did again with this bottle. The wine pours a deep deep ruby in the glas. with dried dark frui. earth and wood on the nose; in the mouth are flavors of black cherr. black licorice and dark chocolate; a touch of vanilla into the finish. . The wine is full bodied and big with punch but delivered very nicel. so well structured.  It really is an example of these “fields” blends done right.  The finish is lasting and long.  Really a delicious wine. For those looking for $15 California red. this is a top contender in my opinion.  Smith &amp; Hook also makes a delicious Cabernet Sauvigno. so keep an eye out for that.  It’s priced a little mor. around $2. but frequently pulls down 90+ ratings from the critics. We  reviewed the 2015 vintage of the Smith &amp; Hook blend last yea. and our reviewer Erin had similar feelings as I had about this current vintage. We’ll be adding this wine to our Top Picks list.

Our Highest Rated Costco Wines of 2020,I think we will all agree that 2020 is a year like no other.  Thankfull. wine has been a bright part of it for me as I imagine it was for many of you. . This is the time of the year when we look back at the Costco wines we reviewed throughout the yea. and line up the ones that we rated the highest. I have to put out the usual disclaimer. Like every item at Costc. wine moves fast; it’s here one da. gone the nex. never to be seen again (except for those rare surprise appearances). So it’s very possible that many of these bottles are no longer on store shelves. But keep an eye out because you never know.  Dig around bins and look under the wooden boxes.  There are always hidden gems to be found. Here’s last year’s list if you want to take a quick peek; lots of new ones this year which is great for building a list of wines to search for. So let’s get into it.  Here are the Costco wines we tasted in 2020 that we rated the highest (starting in January). What a way to start the list off.  This is the “second” wine from famed Bordeaux estate Chateau Malescot St. Exupery and the price was $30.99.  This is a great way to experience top notch Bordeaux wine at a reasonable price.  We went 91 points our review. An exciting new entrant in the Kirkland wine family.  Here’s what we said about the new Kirkland Barolo:. “The price for this Barolo is $19.9. which falls right in the ballpark where we see many higher end Kirkland wines (Pauillac Bordeau.Chateauneu.Brunell.Champagne). In each case the Kirkland price is a fraction what you would normally pay for wines from these premier regions.” We rated it a solid 92 points our review. We were lucky to catch this at a special discounted Costco price.  It’s normally $20 and we scored it for only $12 which is insane.  But it drinks so good it’s a value at $2. and even $30.  We really enjoyed this on. and rated it 91 points our review. It seems like we tasted and reviewed a lot of Russian River Chardonnay this yea. and this bottle from Pellegrini stood out from the pack.  The price was only $15 and it was delicious and memorable.  We rated it 91 points our review. Sometimes a wine just hits you right on every accord and that’s how I felt about this wine.  I was not familiar with the producer (I am no. and enjoy following them on Instagram. and bought this on a whim.  Glad I did. It’s not inexpensive at $2. but that’s off a retail price ofaround $37.  But it drinks way above this Costco price.  A well deserved 92 points from us our review. Always one of our favorite Kirkland wines of the yea. and this current vintage is a perfect example of the quality you get in this wine at a great price.  It’s $24 and creeping up it seem. but anything comparable from Stag’s Leap is going to run you doubl. more like triple that price.  Such a great wine that we rated 91 points our review. Washington State wines are amazin. and still fairly priced. You don’t find that nowadays too many places in the wine world. This bottle is the perfect example though. It was $8.99 and from Red Mountai. one of Washington’s State’s premier regions. Really surprising what you get for the money with this one. Seek out these Washington wines while you still can our review. And if we’re going to call out Washington State wine. we’d be remiss not to call out Paso Roble. and this bottle from Austin Hope is a great way to do it.  Big and elegant go hand in hand here with this amazing bottle of Caberne. coming in at $4. but similar to aforementioned Stag’s Leap win. this one drinks like it cost a lot more; 92 points from us our review. That’s going to wrap it up for 2020. In reviewing all of our ratings this yea. it would be a disservice not to list all the runner ups because we had so many wines rated 89 and 90 points that were so goo. just not at the upper echelon of our reviews. You can review all those here in our ongoing Top Picks list.

2018 N46 North Forty Six Cabernet Sauvignon Red Mountain,There’s no reason to beat around the bush here. This wine is an absolute steal at Costco for only $8.99.. Hailing from Washington State’s premier Red Mountain regio. finding a bottle like this under $10 is almost unheard of. Most of the wines are $30-$40 and up. At the same tim. they are just now getting on the radar of more wine buyer. so there’s never going to be another time like the present. A few weeks ago I published some thoughts on Washington State win. and this bottle lines up perfectly with my conclusio. that wines from the area consistently over-deliver for the price. And thankfully Costco’s corporate wine buyers must agre. as we’ve seen quite a few appear in stores recently. I couldn’t find a lot of information on the wine online and was excited to dig in and see what was inside. This wine pours a medium to dark ruby in the glas. and is full bodied; came alive after a little decant; loads of cherry flavor combined with some dark fruit and spice; super dr. chalky finish.. It really was hard to believe this bottle was only $9. The other party I tasted it with pegged the retail price at $3. and I could see why. I think these are going to move fast once the word gets out. A case buy for sure considering you can get it for around $100.  I’ll be adding this bottle to our Top Picks lis. which doesn’t see too many wines priced this low. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Top Pick. Costco item number: 145419. Alc. 14.5.

2018 Kirkland Signature Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon,Year in and year ou. the Kirkland Stags Leap Cabernet is a reader favorit. and one of mine as well.  The first thing to note as the new vintage hits stores is the price which has stayed the same from the 2017 vintage.  It was starting to creep up a couple bucks every yea. so let’s hope it stabilizes here. Regardles. Costco is offering access to one of the premier regions of Napa at a price that’s virtually unheard of with any other bottle from Stags Leap.  And people in the kno. like all of you who are reading this no. will scoop these bottles up pretty quic. so be on the look out. That’s also why I’m sneaking this review in on a Monda. outside of our regular publishing schedule.  I’ve had a few readers write in about this bottl. but haven’t heard any tasting notes from anyone yet.  The good news is that I think this is the best ones I’ve tasted in years. The wine pours a deep ruby in the glass with a spicy nose of wild cherry aromas; medium plus in bod. similar to the prior 2017 vintage that we found to be a little lighter and more elegant than the bi. large mouthfeel we noted in prior vintages. Black cherry flavors with spice and some mocha; touch of oak into the dry and lasting finish.  Actually the more I dig i. the finish is really nice this yea. exceptionally long. As I mentioned befor. the Kirkland Stags Leap Cab has always been a favorit. and this vintage might actually be one of the best we’ve taste. in our opinion.  I’m going to move up from the 89 point rating. and put this in our Top Picks list territory with a 91 point rating.  Cab lovers will find a lot to like here.

2018 Blank Stare Sauvignon Blanc,This bottle will go down as one of the most interesting Sauvignon Blancs I’ve tasted in years.  It comes to us from Orin Swift Cellars and from the Russian River Valley. . As anyone who’s tasted Orin Swift wines can attes. they can be big and bol. unrestrained; and that’s exactly how this Sauvignon Blanc hit m. and in a good way. The price is $20 at Costc. which is about half of retail which I found onlin. along with some big scores from the wine critics. The wine pours a pale yellow in the glass with stone fruit and mild oak on the nose.  In the mout. this wine is a beas. a rich and flavorful Sauvignon Blanc that is clearly not your everyday expression of the varietal. The wine is medium in bod. flavors of pea. lemo. vanilla and cream; huge mouthfee. very powerful; what you would expect from Orin Swif. and a memorable Sauvignon Blanc for all types of white wine fans. This is definitely one for the more adventurous wine drinker.  The alcohol is 15.5% so it packs a big punch in pretty much every way.  In the en. I enjoyed i. and if nothing els. am happy to have tasted this bottle as it changed my perceptions of what a Sauvignon Blanc can be.

2015 Marques del Atrio Rioja Reserva,We are always on the lookout for bottles that have the special limited time Costco discoun. taking even more off the already low price.  In this case thoug. the discount was just the icing on the cake. This wine is so goo. it’s a steal at the regular price of $14.9. which is still below the retail of $2. and the $6 discount brings it down to only $8.99. . The label on the bottle’s neck proudly displays the 93 point rating from James Sucklin. and Wine Enthusiast also liked this on. awarding it 88 points. Note the special discounted price ends at my Costco on 9/27.  Sometime. but not alway. Costco will make that the new standard price after the discount end. but I wouldn’t wait on this one.  Grab it if you see it. The wine pours a medium to deep ruby in the glas. leaning toward deep; spic. dried red fruit and clove on the nose; the wine is medium plus in bod. elegant with red frui. cherr. raspberry.  Very vibrant and aliv. some dark chocolate notes towards the finish that is dusty and sticky. The blend consists of 85% Tempranillo and 15% Graciano. This is going to be a case buy for me without a doubt. Rioja and Spanish wine fan. this is a home run like I haven’t found in a while. Other fans of red win. give this one a sho. especially if you’re looking at dipping your toe in the Spanish realm. What an example of the value you can get from this region.

2015 Quarisa Mrs Q Cabernet Sauvignon Coonawarra,We realized a nice upside surprise on this bottle.  While I think Australian wines overall seem to be trending in the right direction in terms of price and qualit. I’m still never quite certain what I’m going to get when I pour that first glass. I’ll admit the 93 points from Wine Enthusiast listed on the Costco placard piqued my curiosit. especially since the wine was only $9.99.  Could this really be a 93 point wine for under $10?  There was only one way to find out.. It pours a dee. inky purple in the glas. about as dark as a wine can get.  On the nose I got plenty of spic. peppe. black fruit; in the mouth are flavors of black licoric. black cherr. plu. and blackberry.  It’s full in body; dr. dusty and spicy into finish. This is a racy little red wine that I really came to enjo. albeit not quite in the 93 point territory that Wine Enthusiast placed i. but not too far from that either.  For $10 at Costco it definitely drinks like it cost closer to $20-$25 in my opinion. I’m going to add to our Top Picks lis. and land right at a solid 90 points for this wine.

2017 Balletto Pinot Noir Russian River Valley,There was really no reason to choose this Pinot Noir.  I’ve never heard of this winer. and primarily bought it so I could report back to you about how it turned out.  Just a fun experimen. but ma. once I tasted it I’m really glad I picked this one. . It’s not inexpensive at $2. but that’s off a retail price of around $37. You’ll notice at that link all the 90 point rating. and Wine &amp; Spirits gave the bottle a Best Buy designation.  I wholeheartedly agree with the critics this time.  This is really elegant and delicious Pinot at a pretty fair Costco price. . The wine pours a pale ruby in the glass and has a nice nos. vibrant aromas of red fruit and spice; beautiful mouthfee. medium body; flavors of spicy cherr. col. wild strawberry.  Really a perfect finish. More Burgundian in style. This is a very delicate and elegant wine throughout that drinks like a much more expensive Pinot.

2017 Trimbach Riesling,Here’s a bottle I was pumped to see hit my Costco because I just love wines from Trimbac.  Most of the time I have to purchase them at Total Win. which usually has a nice selection of their white wine varietals. . So it was awesome to see this one arrive into Costco for $16.99.  Retail is $2. and it’s $17-$20 most other places.  Plus I just love wines from Alsac. and usually find them to offer tremendous quality for the price. This wine pours a pale to medium straw in the glass; I didn’t pick up a lot on the nos. just a little stone fruit.  This is a super dry Rieslin. just like I like them.  The trick here is to look for alcohol above 12.5% and you know it’s on the drier side.  That’s probably on the list of wine tips that no one tells yo. that I use the most. In the mout. the wine has flavors of pea. green apple and peach.  It is super crisp and acidi. totally hitting the spot on a hot Atlanta evening. . I heard a quote a few years back about Riesling that I thought really summed it up right. It went something along the lines of “everybody may not like all Riesling. but there’s a Riesling for everybody.. That’s so tru. you just have to explor. and I think this is a great entry point for white wine fans not well versed in Riesling or who hesitate because they’ve tasted a couple of super sweet ones. It is a complicated varieta. especially the German ones that are excellent but one of the most complicated parts of the wine world to navigate.  In the en. it’s a varietal that is worth the exploration. Trimbach is such a great Alsace producer too and consistently deliver. especially with their Pinot Blan. which is another bottle to look for.

2018 Hanna Sauvignon Blanc Russian River Valley,Here’s a fun fin. a Russian River Valley Sauvignon Blanc at a great Costco price of only $12.69.  I do love Sauvignon Blanc on hot summer days so figured we’d give this a shot and see how it turned out.  The short answer: this is a deliciou. super cris. summer wine at a fantastic price. A quick online search turns up a retail price of around $20 for this win. and outlets like Wine.com sells it for $18.  And it certainly drinks like a wine that costs more than Costco’s $12.69 price tag. Wine Enthusiast went 87 points on this win. and Suckling gave it 91.  I’m going to fall in the middl. but still hit the 90 mark as I think this wine is really deserving of it. The wine pours a pale to medium yellow in the glass and kicks off citrus aromas.  It has some of that grapefruit acidit. along with melo. mango and peach flavors; on first drink it reminded me of a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc with the crisp acidity so fans of that style will find a lot to like here.  Light to medium in bod. it has a finish that instantly draws you back for more. On a hot da. poolsid. on a boa. or at a beac. this wine would be irresistible.  It’s fresh and vibran. ready to be enjoyed and impressed us more than expected.  I’m going to add to our Top Picks lis. and on top of all tha. Costco’s price is amazing for a wine of this caliber.

2017 La Crema Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast,I’m going to continue grabbing different Pinot Noirs as I started doing over the past few months.  This La Crema Pinot is a Costco staple and at least around the Atlanta area is pretty widely available.  I hope that you are able to find it as it turned out to be a delicious wine. La Crema is a dependable name and their Chardonnay is available at Costco too at about the same price ($16.39) as this Pinot which was $17.99. That’s a pretty fair price considering that retail is $25 and you can find the wine online for around $20. I’d really like to see it come in a little lower. $14.99 would be perfect. This wine pours a medium ruby in the glass with a nose of rose petal and red fruit; in the mouth are flavors of cherry col. plu. cranberry. This wine has nice acidity and a long lasting finis. with a little pepper and spice.  I really love this finish the more I dig in as it hangs around longer than many of the other Pinots we’ve tasted recently. This is an excellent Pinot buy at Costco and one of the better ones that we’ve found recently under $20.  A good versatile summer red. We’ll be adding to our Top Picks lis. and now I’m really looking forward to getting into the La Crema Chardonna. hopefully soon. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick.

2018 Ferrari-Carano Chardonnay Sonoma,I hold a special place in my wine drinking history for Ferrari-Carano wines.  Early o. when I was just starting ou. it seemed like I would gravitate towards their wines when I wanted something that was “a little step up.” . Plus the name is cool and easy to say; the wines are generally pretty solid too and I had a lot of good times drinking them with friends and family over the years (our recent review of the Siena red blend). It’s been a while since I’ve tasted their Sonoma Chardonnay and I have to say it was a really interesting wine.  Although perhaps not for everyon. I’m glad I picked this one. Costco’s price of $19.99 is decen. but I’d like to see a couple more dollars off.  Online you can find this wine for $22-$23 and I’ve seen it around other retail outlets for $20.. In the glas. the wine pours more of a medium yellow versus gold. Wet ston. tropical fruit on the nose.  The wine is kind of a mix between new world and old world California Chardonnay. It starts off with clean fruit in the mout. pear and peac. then mid palate to finish has a rich buttery vanilla cream;  then there’s almost a little peppermint on the end too that pops up. The Costco placard I believe is referring to it as cinnamon but I get a little more of an Andes mint thing going on. Definitely more of an interesting wine than I was expecting and I think Chardonnay drinkers could go either way. M. I like this style a lot. It’s definitely a touch different and keeps things fun on every sip. If you like oak/butter in your Char. you might think it doesn’t have enough.  If you like clean unoaked Chablis styl. it might be too creamy and oaky.  Wine is individual so to each their ow. but no matter your preferenc. this is a unique wine that I’ll remember tasting for a whil. and I ended up really liking it.

2016 Pellegrini Chardonnay Russian River Valley,It’s starting to feel like summer around the Atlanta are. and that’s when white wine hits the spot for me.  I haven’t found many interesting whites though at the Costcos around us yet. . I’m hoping for some Albarin. German Rieslin. Vinho Verd. Vermentin. Arnei. or even whites from anywhere in France besides the obvious spots.  There’s always plenty of California Chardonnay thoug. and we’ve reviewed a few of them recently. We just tasted the new Kirkland Russian River Chardonnay and it was middle of the road in tast. but pretty affordable at only $13.  This Russian River Chardonnay from Pelligrini was only $2 more at $14.9. so I wanted to see how differen. or better/wors. it might be.. This wine pours medium gold in color with light stone fruit on the nose. Just like it says on the back labe. this is pure Chardonnay. Lots of Chablis like character; great depth; flavors of pea. appl. white peach. . This wine is super crisp and zest. the complete opposite of an oak and butter Chardonnay. This is very much more my styl. and a much stronger offering than the aforementioned Kirkland Chardonnay. The delicious finish keeps you coming back for more. I really love this win. and it is an excellent buy for $15 (retail is $3. and online around $20).  We’ll be adding this wine to our Top Picks list.

2018 Kirkland Signature Chateauneuf du Pape,Look what’s bac. the Kirkland Chateauneuf du Pape is finally making an appearance after a long hiatus. The last vintage of this to hit Costco stores was the 2016 and it was available almost exactly two years ago. And there are a few important things to note about this new bottle. Firs. is the change in the label. Chateau de Naly. the producer of this Kirkland wine for many vintage. was acquired by Rhone producer Guigal in 2017.  So perhaps the change in ownership resulted in the missed vintage?  Hard to say.. Guigal makes some fantastic wine. including a standard Cotes du Rhone that occasionally pops up at Costco for only $13. Guigal also makes their own Chateauneuf du Pape as well as some great Northern Rhone wines.. Als. note the language on the back of the label referencing Guillaume Gonne. whose wine portfolio extends throughout Rhone and beyond.  Here’s some good info about that enterprise. Their standard Chateauneuf bottling starts around $36. The next thing to note is the pric. $20.9. which is amazing for a Chateauneuf as these wines generally start $10-$20 mor. but it is a fair jump from the last vintage that Costco offered for $17.99. So it’s still a good pric. but I don’t like to see it trending in that direction. Now let’s take a look back at our ratings of some prior vintages of this wine. 2016 90 Point. 2015 89 Point. 2014 88 Point. 2013 93 Point. 2012 91 Point. 2011 92 Point. 2010 91 Point. 2009 91 Point. As you can see this one delivers year after year.  So let’s get into this new 2018 vintage. The wine pours a medium ruby in the glass; ripe red berries on the nose with a touch of spice; nice fruit flavor both red and dark frui. spicy red cherr. blackberry and blueberry. Super sticky finish that really digs in especially if you swish the wine a bit. This bottle really grew on me over a couple of hour. and as the wine had a chance to decant. It’s young for a Chateauneuf and the tannins are still pretty sturdy so definitely decant it for about an hour and it’ll shine.  One of our reader. Russel. wrote in too suggesting sitting on this wine for a few years which I agree with if you have the patience.. We paired the wine with some Green Egg hamburgers and that was tasty. You can almost pair a wine like this with about any cuisine. So outside of the price increas. there’s a lot to like here with the new 2018 vintage. I plan to scoop up a couple more to have on han. and perhaps even to age for our Cellar Series. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a CostcoWine Top Pick. Costco item number:77766.

2019 Kirkland Signature Cotes De Provence Rose,I finally found it and there was a whole corner of it still left – the Kirkland Signature Cotes De Provence Ros. which might be the fastest selling Kirkland wine of the bunch.  This is going to move fast so if you see i. buy it. The reason being is that this is consistently high quality French rose that Costco brings in for only $9.9. which is worth noting $1 more than the 2018 vintage. But still an amazing and unmatchable price for this juice. The blend this year is 48% Grenach. 25% Cinsaul. 11% Syra. 9% Carigna. 4% Ugni Blanc and 3% Tibouren.  It’s a very similar breakdown compared to past years and our tasting notes remain very similar as well.

2017 Justin Cabernet Sauvignon Paso Robles,We just reviewed the Daou Caberne. also from Paso Robles and loved i. awarding the wine 90 point. and a spot on our Top Picks list. Costco brought that one in around the same price point as this Justin bottl. so we have two very solid offerings from Paso worth exploring in stores right now. Sometimes I forget what a fantastic bottle of wine this Justin really is for only $20 at Costco.  And if you step it up to their higher end bottling. like the ISOSCELE. which is a Bordeaux blend for around $6. the wines get really really good. We reviewed the 2016 Justin two years ago and awarded it 88 points.  But as I got into this 2017 vintag. I realized right away that I would be moving that score up a ta. especially considering the reasonable price point for such quality juice. The wine pours a deep ruby in the glas. with black fruit and spice on the nose; in the mouth flavors of blackberr. black cherr. anise with some mocha into the finish; really nice lingering spice in the finish. I love the versatility of a bottle like thi. and it makes me want to just drop a bottle (one at least) of this in my cart every trip to Costco just to have on hand. . Sur. it’s not an inexpensive win. but it’s perfect in every occasion; great with all kinds of foo. classy enough to take to a dinner party to please a crowd; a nice gift for a wine loving friend.  And when you just don’t know what else to ope. it’s always a solid pick.  It’s similar to how I feel about Rhone wines.  I can enjoy those almost anytim. with anythin. anybody. Like we mentioned in the Daou revie. there are amazing wines in Napa and Sonoma and they come with a hefty price tag.

2018 Louis Jadot Pouilly-Fuisse,I love it when we get a nice string of wines that all hit our Top Picks list.  It doesn’t happen that often since we really try to reserve this list for the best Costco wines we fin. and rate 90+ points.  But when it doe. it makes this job a lot more fun. We could all use some good juice right now so I hope you are able to find some of these wines at your local warehouse. Get ready to pull this one out an enjoy on a nice day. Louis Jadot is a big producer of French wine across a few different appellations in Burgundy.  Just last yea. we reviewed their excellent Chablis that appeared at Costco for $20 and was rated 90+ points by most of the critics.  We went 90 points too. The price at Costco for their Pouilly-Fuisse was $23.9. which is pretty good.  Retail appears to be $2. and the wine is online for $24-$26.. The wines of Pouilly-Fuiss. located in the Maconnais in the Southern part of Burgund. are stylistically different than Chabli. although both of these wines are excellent buy. and both are expressions of Chardonnay. . Chablis is known for its clea. stainless steel finished wine. whereas Pouilly-Fuisse is more ric. full bodied and toasty with mild oak influence. For $2. this Louis Jadot Pouilly-Fuisse tasted like a much more expensive White Burgundy.  Let’s get into it. In the glas. the wine pours a medium gold color; stone fruit and mild oak on nose; medium plus in body; baked appl. butterscotc. lemo. and pineapple flavors; mild oak into a very lasting finish. This is an excellent value and a classy Burgundian wine at this price.  This bottle is probably one of the best ways to enter and experience wines from this complicated region without breaking the bank too much.  Most comparable Burgundian wines cost 2-3X as much and don’t always delivery the goods like this wine does. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a Costco Wine Blog Top Pick.

2017 Foxglove Chardonnay Central Coast,The Foxglove Chardonnay is one of those wines that you frequently see listed in write ups with headlines like “Best summer white wine buy.” or “Best whites under $15.”  That was how I first learned about it. I can’t remember the list that I read a couple years ag. but I remember seeking this wine out as a resul. and really enjoying it. To see it pop at Costco for only $11.99 is a real treat.  It’s $15+ at most online outlet. and I believe that’s about what I paid for it before when I saw it at Total Wine. The reason I really enjoy this bottle is because the style really lets the fruit shine through.  It’s not packed with butte. cream and oak.  Quite the contrary actuall. this wine tastes to me more like a Chabli. or even an Albarin. than it does a California Chardonnay by traditional standards. The fruit is mostly from Santa Barbara county with a little coming from Paso.  The wine pours a medium gold color in the glass and has tropical fruit on the nose.  That tropical fruit carries into the flavors in the mouth of lemo. pineappl. and orange peel. The wine is medium in body with a good dose of acidity.  Super clean and crisp into the finish.  There’s just a lot to like here for $1. and this wine really does check every bo. including price. If you find this one no. it might be worth stocking up for the summer.  I imagine most people who know about this win. and who have tasted i. won’t hesitate to scoop a few up at only $12 a bottle. . I bought fou. but wish I had more now that I’ve tasted this 2017 vintage and it delivers the goods.  I’m going to add to our Top Picks list.

2018 Daou Cabernet Sauvignon Paso Robles,When it comes to wines from the U.S. outside of Napa and Sonom. I’ve said before I’m really enjoying a lot of reds from WA Stat. and I am finding them to be good values.  Oregon of cours. New York’s Finger Lakes and I think Virginia is an up and comer. Paso Robles is another area in CA that can sometimes get overlooked (Santa Cruz mountains too).  And thankfull. Costco seems to cycle Paso bottles in the mix regularl. including this excellent one from Daou. Costco’s price was $22.9. which is not quite as good as I would have hoped.  A quick Internet search will show the retail price around $3. most online outlets between $20-$2. and some even offering this wine as low as $18 a bottle.  If we could score this wine closer to the $18 mark at Costco it would be a steal. But that sai. we have a very nice wine here even at $23.  From my online researc. it appears that it is actually a bit more of a Bordeaux blen. consisting of 78% Cabernet Sauvigno. 13% Merlo. 8% Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc. The wine pours a medium to deep ruby color with ripe red fruit on the nose; spicy cherry and wild strawberry flavors with some mocha and cedar notes into the dusty finish; it really sticks and coats the mouth nicely. We thought this was a tasty little trea. and it was a perfect complement with the steaks we grilled. If you like CA wine. but don’t venture off the Napa/Sonoma path very ofte. I’d highly recommend checking out some of Paso’s wines.  They’re delivering a good bang for the buck right no. and this bottle from Daou is a perfect place to start.

2017 Seghesio Zinfandel,The Seghesio Zinfandel is one of those Costco staple wines that I look forward to every year.  A little bit of a surprise this year is the price moved down to $19.9. from $20.89 last year.  Not a lot but movement in the right direction. You can also find it online for $19.9. so Costco might still have some room to play with this price.  Regardles. for $2. it’s a delicious wine.  We loved the 2016 vintage of this win. rating it 91 point. which matches pretty much all the high critical praise this wine always receives. . As is always the cas. this wine is a blend and here’s the breakdown for this new 2017 vintage: 87% Zinfande. 9% Petite Sira. 2% Carignan. 1% Syrah and 1% other reds.  Last year there was a tad less Zin and more Petite Sirah. The wine pours a medium purple color and is just barely see through.

The normal Costco price of $19.99 for this one is goo. not grea. but knocking an additional $8 off makes this an insane buy on a delicious Chardonnay. Granted this deal is good through 5/10/2. and I found it at a Costco in the Atlanta area.  I have no idea how far this deal will travel but keep your eye out.

2017 Kirkland Signature Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon,Right on the heels of the new Kirkland Barolo that we just tasted and really enjoye. we are lucky enough to have Costco also grace us with a classic Kirkland favorit. the Oakville Cabernet. Costco’s Kirkland label produces a number of Cabernet from Napa including a Rutherfor. a Napa Valley blen. and a Stags Lea. but this Oakville is usually among our favorites. We went 91 points on the 2015 vintag. 90 points last year on the 2016 vintag. and now this year we’re going to stay consistent and award a nice 90 points to this 2017 vintage. Similar tasting notes as the prior year bottles.

2015 Kirkland Signature Barolo,Several readers alerted us last week that this new Kirkland offering was hitting Costco store shelve. and I was able to find it this weekend. The price for this Barolo is $19.9. which falls right in the ballpark where we see many higher end Kirkland wines (Pauillac Bordeau. Chateauneu. Brunell. Champagne). In each case the Kirkland price is a fraction what you would normally pay for wines from these premier regions. I couldn’t wait to taste i. and I’m happy to report that it hit me right on all fronts. This is a delicious wine for the money and a nice new addition to the Kirkland family of wines. Barolo wines start at $30 (and sometimes aren’t that great. and go up from there into the several hundred dollars a bottle. So for $2. we have found a winner here. The wine pours a medium garnet color and it is light enough that you can slightly see through it in the glass. On the nose is dried red fruit and a little spice; medium plus in body with flavors of spicy black cherr. a little blackberr. some anise and pepper towards the finish that is ultra dry. The back of the label doesn’t offer up too much information on the produce. but I did see a little hint around the top of the bottle. There’s a band around the top with the name Simone Tablino written in cursive. (Pretty sure that’s what it say. but if anyone sees that differentl. let us know). I tried Googling the name (and some other variations) along with “Barolo” and other related search terms but didn’t come up with a lot.The main link I found was to a collection of wine reviews written by someone with that name. So I’m not sure what that represent. and remain kind of curious about it. Overal. I’m really happy to see this new Kirkland offering and it’s offered at a very fair price. Italian wine fans will find a lot to like her. and this bottle makes makes it easy to enjoy a really nice wine more often than just a special occasion when you might be paying two or three times as much for a wine like this.

2015 Chateau Malescot-St-Exupery La Dame de Malescot Margaux,Long time readers will know that I’m a Bordeaux love. particularly left ban. and I love finding them at Costco because more times than no. the price is impossible to beat. We saw this with the 2015 Pontet-Canet that I found at Costco for $9. and the next day saw the same bottle at Total Wine for $220. Obviousl. an insane buy there. . But Costco will also pop in these “second” bottles from top Bordeaux Estates.  These are wines that typically utilize younger vines on the estat. and while they are not quite up to the maturity to warrant being included in the First win. they still represent a great entry point into these estates. We saw the Le Petit Haut Lafitt. second bottle from Chateau Smith Haut  Lafitte in Pessa. hit Costco earlier this year for $28.  I had a First bottle from Chateau Smith Haut Lafittein my cellar (price around $110-120 depending on the vintage) so actually pitted them side by side.  The First wine was definitely a jump u. but the second wine held pretty strong for a lot less dough. . I didn’t have a First bottle from Chateau Malescot St. Exupery (price around $130) so today we’re just taking a look at their second wine that I found at my Costco.  I’ve had readers write in to me about both bottle. so depending on your warehous. you may be able to find the first wine too.  I haven’t seen i. and am not sure on Costco’s price for that one. This wine is a beauty though and it’s from a strong vintage in Bordeaux.  Most wineries would be happy to have this wine as their signature bottling.  Spic. expressive nose; big flavo. lots of cherr. dark fruit with dark chocolate and plum notes; medium plus in body; big dry finish. At $30 this is a delicious wine and it really makes me want to taste their first wine now.  The Chateau is located right down the street from famed Chateau Margau. and looking the other directio. it is right next to another of my top Bordeaux propertie. Chateau Palme. whose delicious Alter Eg. their second bottl. hit Costco last year. Give this Bordeaux a little ai. a nice meal and some good company and it will serve you well for $30.  I like this wine a lot at this price poin. and would probably pick it over the aforementioned Le Petit Haut Lafitte. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 point. Costco item number: 11939.

2016 Castello di Monsanto Chianti Classico Riserva,This is an interesting vintage of a perennial favorite Costco wine.  Als. one that tends to see a wide distributio. so hopefully readers will be able to find it in their local warehouse. Historicall. this wine has been at Costco for under $20.  The last vintage was $17.8. but this year we’re seeing a price increase to $20.89.  I never like to see price increases on our favorite wines obviousl. but this one still remains lower than most places.  Wine.com for instanc. sells it for $28.99.  Other outlets are closer to the low $20s range. We’re also coming off a huge year for this wine as the 2015 vintage was a beast.  We loved it.  The critics went gaga for it.  I still have a couple bottles because I think it will be really fun to open in a few years. . The 2014 vintage was also stron. and we went 90 points on that one.  Dig around your bins though and make sure there are not any 2015 vintages still hanging around.  That’s the one to buy.I actually didn’t like this new 2016 vintage right out of the bottle. The acidity was through the roof.  Grante. I like the lively nature of this wine but it was a bit much to start with.  After some air time though it chilled out a bit and I was able to taste its true character. . It has a lovely nose that is earthy and perfumy.  Excellent mouthfeel; loads of cherr. spicy black cherr. anise with a hint of peppermint (nice touch during the holidays. tangy acidity throughout into a bone bone dry finish. This remains an excellent wine and fantastic Chianti buy but I think it’s too early to drink this vintage. It needs another yea. maybe two and at a minimu. it needs a good decant. I think all the elements are there for this to be another fantastic vintage. On that accor. it’s a 90 point wine once again but perhaps not the 93-94 pointer that the critics awarded it. I’m going a solid 91 and I bet if I tasted it again in 2-3 years it would be 92-93.  It kind of falls in between the ’14 and ’15 vintages for me. Buy a couple if this sounds like your kind of win. and if you’ve enjoyed it before. Drink one now for fun and throw a couple away for a few years and see what happens.  I think you will be rewarded in just another 2-3 years. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick. Costco item number: 3448. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. G.

2015 Nickel &amp; Nickel Suscol Ranch Merlot,Nickel &amp; Nickel is easily among my top ten favorite wineries in Napa.  They specialize in single vineyard expressions of different varietals from various locations in and around the Napa Valley. . Nickel &amp; Nickel was founded by the owners at Far Nient. another favorit. located right down the street.  I had the chance to visit Nickel &amp; Nickel a couple years ago and it was an amazing experience; they were wonderful host. the property is the definition of perfection and the wine of course is lovely.. The label on their wines is about as distinctive as they come so I spotted this one a mile away in the Costco bin and got excited.  I was hoping for one of the Cabs but was still happy to find this Merlo. as I’ve always enjoyed the Merlots from them I’ve tasted too. . The price was $49.9. which is good not great.  Online this bottle can be found for that same pric. and Total Wine carries it for a bit more at $58.00.  Total Wine is actually a very good place to buy Nickel &amp; Nickel wines as they usually carry a ton. . One of the cool things about my tasting at the winery was being able to taste the single vineyard wines all side by side.  If I had a spare $600 laying aroun. I’d buy six different bottles of their Cabs at Total Win. and replicate that tasting.  It was a lot of fun. But let’s get into this Merlot.   It was dark on the pou. with a lively nose of cherry and baking spices.  In the mout. more cherry and wild strawberry flavor. herbal notes; the wine is full bodied with a touch of vanilla towards the end; big juicy finish. I had the wine in a decanter over the course of a couple hours and poured a taste every now and then.  It definitely improved with a little ai. opening up and letting the fruit come alive.  When I first poured a glass right after openin. I was a bit disappointed as it started very close. but luckily that changed. Suckling went 91 points and I think this is definitely a 90 pointe. but I might just stay right at 90.  It’s a delicious win. and one that Merlot fans will love as well as those who tend to favor Cabs.  At $5. this Merlot is half the price (at least) as a Nickel &amp; Nickel Cabs. . And I love those Cab. but I think this bottl. along with some other Merlots I’ve tasted recently (Duckhor. Seave. Pride come to mind. that CA Merlot is a good place to look for high quality wine for the mone. albeit still at a pretty high price point.

2009 La Rioja Alta Gran Reserva 904,Wine buyers who know about this wine and see it at their Costco are probably like m. and go on autopilo. feverishly shoveling these in their cart until they’ve reached their budget (or their spouse starts asking questions. only to put the bulk toilet paper back in the hopes to squeeze in one more. Or maybe it’s just me. This bottle is certainly not inexpensiv. but for the quality of the juice insid. especially this vintag. it is an unbelievable buy. There are many wines priced . . 4X this one that aren’t even in the same league. Compared to year’s pas. Costco’s price did go up a tad here. Historically you’ve been able to score this wine for $39.9. but the price today is $48.99. Still a bargain in my opinion. Here’s what we had to say about the 2001 vintag. and the 2004 vintage. The Rioja 904 and its more premium older brothe. the Rioja 89. are not produced every year. There was no 904 in 200. but there is going to be one for 2010 that I’ve already heard high praise about. But for no. this 2009 vintage of the 904 might be the gem to know about it and I’ll tell you why. I. 2009 they didn’t produce the higher end 890 bottling. So all the grapes usually reserved for that higher end wine (priced $100+) are in this 904. And perhaps that’s why it’s standing out to me this year a bit more compared to previous vintages. Those grapes by the way are a blend of 90% Tempranillo and 10% Graciano. Give the wine a little air as it needs to open up. It’s almost a decade old but it fres. juicy and drinking really nice right now. That’s not to say it doesn’t have aging potential too.. I’d recommend buying a fe. opening one now to see what you’ve got and enjoy. Then put a couple away for whenever the time comes. That’s what I do every time I see this wine and now I have a handful of every vintage the wine was produced dating back to 2001. A vertical taste would be fun sometime. The nose jumps out of the glas. spicy with a little vegetable garden; cherr. strawberry and plum flavors surrounded by peppery spic. a touch of bell pepper; delicate and elegan. I could drink this wine all day long. Finishes dry and spicy. Super fresh for its ag. with the structure to go for the long haul. This is a beautiful win. and an easy addition to our Top Picks list.

2015 Allegrini Palazzo Della Torre,This bottle is an absolute steal at Costco.  Not only is it a delicious win. but Costco’s price is unbeatable.  Online this one runs as high as $2. and at best  around $17-$18.  Costco’s price is $12.99.  Run don’t walk to pick these up. It’s also the perfect winter re. just pleasant throughou. great frui. a nice dry finish; this wine can pair with so much and is excellent just on it’s own. The blend is 40% Corvina Verones. 30% Corvinon. 25% Rondinell. and 5% Sangiovese.   Every critic I could find gave this a 90+point ratin. including James Suckling who went as high as 94 point. which is pretty insane for a bottle that you can score for $13. So what does this blend taste like?  The wine pours a nice medium dar. ruby red; nose of spicy black cherr. black licorice and little musty scent;  Juicy and full bodied in the mouth with loads of black cherry and blackberry; as I said befor. the finish is bone dry. . Overal. this is a nicely balanced and unbelievably elegant wine at this price point.  When tastin. I hadn’t done any research on the ratings and actually thought I paid $20 for the bottl. and I was still super impressed even then.  At $1. it’s just that much better. If you’re looking for value reds under $1. put this one at the top of your list.  On the other side of the spectru. I continue to see the Wines of Substance CS Cabernet still lingering for the same price.  This is another top pick of ours under $1. and was on Wine Spectator’s Top 100 wines of 2019.

2015 Redi Orbaio Toscana Rosso,Here’s a wine that a reader alerted me t. and on my next Costco visit…ba. there it was.  This is a Tuscan blend that Costco is offering for $19.99. That compares to a retail that appears to be $30+ and an online price of around $25. While poking around the Web about this win. I found a few different breakdowns of the varietal. but I’m not sure how they netted out exactly for this vintage. I made few guesses but then a commentor let us know that the wine this year is comprised of Sangiovese and Merlot. On the pour the wine is a light ruby red and you can faintly see a finger through it; aromati. floral nose with dried fruit and spice; in the mouth is loads of spicy black cherry (reminiscent of NyQuil but tasty. a bit of leather and anise; it’s soft and light in the mouth; very elegant all around with a delicate finish.  This wine is drinking perfectly right now. This is a really nice buy at a fair price; it’s a perfect food win. a perfect winter weather win. and very crowd friendly.  I think readers will find the elegance to be rather impressive for a wine under $20.  I’m going to add it to our Top Picks list. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick.

2017 Elk Cove Estate Pinot Blanc, I admit I’m a sucker for top wine lists. I have to look at the. and that’s what locked me into buying this wine. I noticed it was listed as the #5 wine on Wine Enthusiast’s Top 100 wines of 2018 and I thought that was pretty interesting for an Oregon Pinot Blanc priced this reasonably. That i. until I opened it and tasted the wine. It’s absolutely amazing and an incredible buy at Costco for only $13.99 (retail is around $19). Wine Enthusiast ended up awarding the wine 92 points. The wine is ligh. see through clear on the pour with an aromatic nose of citrus fruit; it is medium in body and packed with flavors of pea. white peach and green apple. Excellent finish that is subtle and elegant. This is a very nice effort all aroun. and a wine that caught us a little off guard. The label and branding looks to me like it would belong on more a generic inexpensive wine from Aldi. And I don’t always agree with the critic. but they picked a winner her. and I don’t care what kind of package this wine is wrapped in. Fans of Oregon whites of all sorts will love this wine. Fans of other whites should give it a try too. I’ll be adding to the Top Picks lis. and love the price to value ratio on this bottle.

2019 Costco Wine Thanksgiving Picks,All righ. it’s that time of the year again when we recommend some of out favorite Costco wines to enjoy with the Thanksgiving meal. This year I went to three Costco stores around the Atlanta area (Woodstoc. Kennesa. Cumberland) to make sure these wines were still in stock before adding them to the list. . Because we are independent of Costc. there’s no way we can tell if these are available nationall. but we hope that you are able to find some of them near you too. I usually like to put out an assortment of different wines on my table for the Big Meal.  This means bubbl. ros. whites and reds.  Just about everyone can find something in there they enjoy and each one will pair with the meal a little differently. . So have fu. go experimen. and remember for this mea. there are a lot of opinions on what pairs with wha. but it’s really such a smorgasbord of different food and flavor. so I consider it open season on the pairing.  Time to explore. Bubbl. Kirkland Champagn. No question about it as long time readers kno. we absolutely love this wine for $20.  It’s impossible to find real Champagne this good at this price point. Kirkland Prosecc. If you want more bang for the buc. look no further than the Kirkland Prosecc. that is highly drinkable and very enjoyable for only $6.99.  This is a crowd pleaser and the price is right if you have a large party.  Rosé.  2018 Commanderie de la Bargemone Coteaux d’Aix en Provence Rose. This might be a hard one to fin. but it’s still out ther. and it is delicious; totally caught us off guard.  Put it on the table and watch people fall in love.  The Gerard Bertrand Rosé is out there still too with its super cool bottle (we haven’t reviewed it recently but need to. White.  2015 First Drop Mere et Fils Adelaide Hills Chardonnay. A super classy Australian Chardonnay that will please the most hard core white wine fa. and do it for $15.  Love this white.  2017 Zorzettig Sauvignon Blanc. Hard to believe the quality you get here for only $12 in this Italian Sauvignon Blanc.  I stocked up on this one as it’s a gem in this price range.  2018 Prelius Vermentino Maremma Toscana. Let’s stay Italia. and keep in that same price range; mix it up a bit with this Vermentino that is delicious for $13.  2018 Charles Krug Napa Sauvignon Blanc. One more Sauvignon Blan. this time from a famed estate many of you will know in California; what a wine this is for only $13. Red.  2016 Seghesio Sonoma Zinfandel. One of my favorite wines for Thanksgiving as it’s generally included on these annual lists.  You might see the 2017 vintag. which we plan to get to very soon.  This is a delicious wine that can really pair with any cuisin. as well as anybody.  2017 Firesteed Pinot Noir Willamette Valley. How about a Pinot Noir for $10 that drinks above its pay grade?  Look no further than the Firesteed from Oregon’s Willamette Valley.  Tasty juice and hard to beat in this price range.  2018 Domaine des Falaises Angelliaume Chinon. If you have a wine nerd coming over sometimes you have to throw something a little different in the mix.  Chinon is a good way to go.  Made from Cabernet Fran. it’s a bit differen. but also a bit interesting.  I didn’t see this one in the Atlanta area on my last roun. but have heard it’s still out there from some Twitter peeps.  And we really enjoyed it. And just a little bonus for any of you who want to celebrate with something a little more specia. I came across two wines at Costco that I have always really enjoyed.  Costco’s price is goo. not great (I’d like to see another 5-10% off compared to my big box retailer. but I felt compelled to buy them both.  I hope to review them soon too. That’s it for now.

2015 Zenato Alanera Rosso Veronese,I completely picked this wine out of the blu. figuring that a little something different from the Italian landscape would be fun.  And not that I read too much into i. but it was hard not to notice the 93 point rating from James Sucklin. for a bottle that was $11.79 at my Costco (online for $1. retail around $20). . I was just hoping for a good bu. but this wine turned out to deliver a lot more than that.  Not a 93 pointer for m. but not too far of. and this is an amazing price for an elegant and super enjoyable wine.. This wine comes from Italy’s Valpolicella region and while I couldn’t confirm the exact varietal makeu. it appears to be dominated by Corvin. likely with smaller parts of Rondinell. Corvinon. Merlo. and Cabernet Sauvignon.  The wine is light and elegant in the mout. but packs a nice punch and drinks way above its pay grade. It has that signature Italian dusty library book on the nose with a bit of dried fruit.  Super juicy and alive in the mouth with flavors of black cherr. dark berry fruit and pomegranate; finishes up dry and dusty. My first reaction was that this is the ultimate every day food and pizza win. and it could definitely fit that bill.  But there’s more going on here.  This is a well structure. rather elegant wine that still leaves me guessing how it’s only $12. I’d be ready to stock up on this bottle if you find it at your local Costc. especially fans of Italian wines like Amaron. Chianti and Super Tuscans.  I think you’d be hard pressed to find an Italian wine of comparable quality at the same price point.  I intend to stock up for the winter if I see this one again. .

Our Highest Rated Costco Wines of 2019,Alrigh. here it i. our annual list of the highest rated Costco wines that we tasted during the year. . I have to put out the usual disclaimer.  Like every item at Costc. wine moves fas. it’s here one da. gone the nex. never to be seen again.  So it’s very possible that many of these bottles are no longer on store shelves. That sai. I should say that sometimes certain wines make special appearances out of the blue. This just happened last week on my last trip to Costco. This fantastic bottl. which we reviewed exactly two years ag. appeared on the shelves of my Costco. Not a new vintag. but​ ​the same 2010 vintage that we reviewed. I was astonished and obviously bought a few. So keep your eyes out for these wine. and hec. maybe even review last year’s “Best of” list.  Who knows what you might run into.  I love the Costco Hunt. So without further ad. let’s take a look at the Highest Rated Costco Wines of 2019. 2017 Zuccardi Concreto Malbec. We really went gaga for this Malbec that caught us completely off guard. Great Costco price of $2. compared to retail of $38; Suckling went 96 points; we went 93. Definitely a bottle to watch out for in case it pops up near you. Our Revie. 2016 Seghesio Sonoma Zinfandel. Always one of our favorite Costco offerings every yea. the 2016 vintage didn’t disappoint. This is a great one for the winter months if you have a chance to pick a few u. a lovely wine for right around $20. Our Revie. 2014 Robert Mondavi Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon 1.5L. This is an important wine for this list.  Every year during the holiday. Costco will bring in their big 1.5L and above wines.  During the seaso. these are generally good buys.  But after the holiday. they turned into unbelievable buy. with most being discounted about half price. So this 1.5L Oakville Mondavi could be had for $4. the same price as a regular bottle of the same wine and vintage. Fingers crossed they discount them again this year. Our Revie. 2015 Monsanto Chianti Classic. Another Costco classic is the Monsanto Chianti. We’ve reviewed every vintage of this win. and this year we reviewed the 2014 and 2015 vintages side by side. The 2014? A good win. worthy of 90 points. The 2015? Even bette. supper impressive for $18. I’ve seen this wine still lingering out there. Look for the 2015 vintage if you can (might have to dig around the bin a bi. but worth it). Our Revie.  2013 Tapiz Black Tears Malbec. Not an inexpensive Malbec by any means ($50 retai. $39 Costco) but one that upped my palate to what a finely crafted Malbec can deliver.  I went 93 points on this on. and have added it to my mental list of go-to bottles.  I would love to see this one back in Costco stores. Our Revie. 2016 Mosquita Muerta Sapo de Otro Pozo Blend de Tintas. Fancy title for this Argentenian red blend comprised of  60% Malbe. 20% Syrah and 20% Cabernet Franc that we found to be delicious for only $20.  Big scores from the critics as well.  We went 92 points. Our Revie.  2016 Ben Marco Malbec. Erin went 91 points on this consistent Malbec that overdelivers for the discounted Costco price of only $1. making it likely the least expensive wine on this list.  I’ve seen them lingering around still in store. so keep an eye out.  The regular Costco price is $1. and it’s still an amazing buy at that price. Our Revie.  2017 Zorzettig Sauvignon Blanc. A $12 Italian Sauvignon Blanc that is a spectacular buy.  Erin noted ” Italian Sauvignon Blan. for the most par. is not like others. I think it tastes like a New World Bordeaux blend.”  And we awarded it 91 points.  Our Revie.  2015 Chateau Saintayme St Emilion Grand Cru. I was really happy to find this Saint-Emilion Grand Cru for only $1. and even happier upon tasting it to learn what a great wine was inside.  Super buy here on a bottle with a retail price closer to $25.  You just don’t get access to this quality of juice at this price very often. Our Revie. And that concludes our list of the highest rated wines we tasted from Costco in 2019.  It’s possible we’ll run into a few more gems between now and the end of the year so will update this post accordingly. I also want to thank all you for following the site.  We love searching for Costco wine. tasting them and sharing our thoughts with you.  We appreciate all the support and feedback as well. .

2014 Hedges Marcel Dupont Les Gosses Red Mountain Syrah, Running into this bottle was a real surpris. particularly at a Costco in the Atlanta area. This is a small batch Syrah from Red Mountain in Washington State’s Yakima Valley. Normall. I would expect to see something like this limited in distribution to Costco stores near where the wine is produce. not a few thousand miles away. But boy am I glad I found it. This is an amazing wine at a very discounted price ($19.99). Online shows the bottle retailing closer to $4. and there were 3025 cases produced. I also noticed on the label that Wine Advocate gave the wine 93 point. which is not something you see often on a $20 wine. And it delivered. This is 100% Syrah that is dark on the pour with a huge mouthfeel; full bodie. just a delicious wine. Flavors of cherr. blueberr. a nice red and dark fruit mix with a bit of 7-11 blue raspberry slurpie; spicy finish. This is Syrah done righ. and it’s just begging for some BBQ ribs off the smoker. But if that’s not an optio. I could also enjoy this wine with something as simple as delivery pizza or as fancy as a $70 steak. I’m going to put a few of these away if I can still find it for the winter months. Very nice juic. an amazing pric. and a perfect addition to our Top Picks list.

2018 Kirkland Signature Cotes du Rhone Villages,O. this might be the most ridiculous Kirkland wine buy that we’ve ever tasted. The Kirkland CDR Villages just keeps getting better and better every year. Last year around this same tim. I reviewed the 2017 vintage and bumped it up to 88 point. from a previous 87.  This year there is no doubt that I’m bumping it up again to a very well deserved 89 points. This wine is flat out ridiculous for the pric. which I’m so grateful has remained the same at $6.99. I was thrilled to see it hit my Costco store and as I was in the process of moving six bottles into the wine box in my car. another Costco member noticed and asked me if it was a good wine. My repl. “If you like red win. ye. it’s one of the best buys in the store right now.” Then I thought to myself that it might even be better than the value you can get from rotisserie chicken. Dubliner cheese and Kirkland olive oil. But I digress. I’ve noted in the pas. that access to wines like this justify the Costco membership fee almost by themselves.  If you like Rhone wine. stock up while you can.. The wine is dark on the pour; spicy and perfume on nose; excellent in the mout. medium plus in bod. mostly dark frui. blueberr. blackberr. pepper and spice in the finish that lingers for a while. An unbelievable wine for the money. And a good one even if it was priced at $2. which is common with many comparable Cotes du Rhone Villages bottles. If I walked into a Costco with $30 in my pocke. I would get absolutely nothing.  Just kidding…if I walked into a Costco with $30 in my pocket to buy win. I would buy this CDR Villages and precede it in the night with the Kirkland Champagne for $20.   If you do tha. you just drank pretty awesomely for your money.  That might be my plan for many nights in the future. Although this one isn’t quite at the 90 point threshold that I usually reserve for Top Pick wine. I’m going to put it on the lis. because of the insane value to be had here. Stock up as this one might not last long once the word gets out.

2016 Domaine Thierry Mothe Chablis Grand Cru Bougros,"Whether I’m shopping at Costc. Total Wine or any of my other go to wine spot. I’m always on the look out for Chabli. and if I find Grand Cru Chabli. that’s just a bonus. Most bottles of Chablis represent an expression of
Chardonnay that works for me. I love the
fruit forward approac. with less focus on the oak and butter. Stylisticall. it lets the grapes and terroir
speak for itself. You may have seen the Kirkland Premier Cru Chabli. also from the 2016 vintag. that we reviewed earlier this year. I thought it was a pretty good buy at $17.99 and a step up from the previous vintage. But today we’re taking it up a notch with this Grand Cru
Chablis.. There are seven Grand Crus “climats” (or areas) in Chablis:
Les Clo. Vaudesi. Valmu. Les Preuse. Grenouill. Blanchot and the one we
are tasting toda. which is Bourgros. Ye. the price tag goes up when you hit the grand
cru level; this bottle is at Costco for $38.99. So while it’s not an inexpensive win. there’s a lot to love about it that justifies the price. This is clearly not your Premier Cru offering. It has more dept. more body and richnes. and a finish that I couldn’t get enough of. Let’s dig in. The wine starts with some minerality on the nose along with green apple and lime aromas; the wine is medium-plus to almost full in body and it feels great in the mouth; I picked up citrus flavors and a bit of orange peel; nice acidity; on the finish are notes of caramel with a touch of vanilla and a slight lingering orange liqueur. The finish is really what sets this apart from most other “general” Chablis.. This wine hit right into my wheelhouse and represents a strong buy for Chablis and Chardonnay fans. There’s no doubt this one could lie down for a bit too and get even more interesting after a few more years in the bottle. A nice addition to our Top Picks list.

2015 Chateau Saintayme St Emilion Grand Cru,I love finding wines like this at Costco and this one turned out to be even more of a gem than I expected. A 2015 Saint Emilion Grand Cru for $16.59. What a deal. My first reaction is a little skeptical but then consider the monstrous ratings from virtually every critic that are all 90+ points. 92 from Wine Spectator and 91 Wine Advocate (I know the Costco sign in the picture below says 90 points for WA but I found 90/92 online; so we can split the difference and say 91). 94 from Decanter. Retail price is $25. Now this is shaping up to an interesting wine. On top of tha. this wine is the project of a well known produce. a fact I didn’t realize until I say down to write the review. Saintayme is the Saint Emilion property of Denis Duranto. who produces the highly regarded Chateau L’Eglise Clinet in Pomerol. So what’s inside the bottle? A delicious and elegant Merlot from a great vintage; a wine that is enjoyable no. but can certainly lay down for bit. For that reason. It’s a wine I plan to add to the cellar and revisit in a few more years. Flora. earthy nose of dried frui. medium in body; flavors of boysenberr. cherr. dark chocolate; a finish that’s really about as dry as you can get. The wine lingers forever. Just gorgeous all around. If you enjoy Bordeaux wine. this is one of the best Bordeaux buys I’ve encountered in a whil. at any store. Even at its retail price of $2. it’s a steal.

2018 Commanderie de la Bargemone Coteaux d’Aix en Provence Rose,"This was the only Rose at my Costco on the day I was there
that I hadn’t tasted befor. so I figured I’d give it a shot. And I’m glad that I did and have the chance
to report back to all of you.. This wine is absolutely delicious and completely caught me
off guard. I did some poking around
after writing my notes and it turns out that the critics agree. It received a 91 from Wine Enthusiast and a
90 from Wine Advocate. Not bad for a wine that retails for $21 but Costco is
selling for $12.99. I plan to stock up
if it’s still hanging around my Costco on my next visit. I’m sure all of you will be looking for it
too now. The blend is 40% Grenach. 25% Cabernet Sauvigno. 20% Syra.
10% Cinsaul. and 5% Rolle. It pours a
light pink in color with a juicy nose with fresh flowers. In the mout. the wine has strawberr. cherry
and pear flavor; dry finish. Ver. very nice. Clearly a Rose you can drink year-round and a stand out Costco Rose for me this year. This makes a nice addition to our Top Picks list.

2015 First Drop Mere et Fils Adelaide Hills Chardonnay,I think we are in the middle of a resurgence in Australian wine. For some reaso. it seems that outside of the occasional Shiraz I would encounte. I didn’t come across a lot of Aussie wine. whether I’m looking at Costco or elsewhere over the past five years. I know they’re there; I just wasn’t seeking them out or buying them often. Maybe it’s me but now I’m not only seeing more Aussie wine. but I’m enjoying them more than ever. This bottle was interesting as the label doesn’t really call out that it’s from Australi. just the region in Southern Australi. “Adelaide Hill.” which many people might be familiar with. I’m not sure I’ve had many Chardonnays from the area so was curious what was inside. Turns out this was an absolutely delicious wine from start to finish. It pours a light pale yellow in the glas. distinctive nose that gives clues to its Southern Hemisphere root. and then this wine is just clean as a whistle. Little to no oak with awesome flavor of white peac. nectarine and pear. On the finish a touch of creaminess and vanilla. This style of Chardonnay is going to find a big audience; it’s versatil. food friendl. and hard to beat for under $15. Retail is $2. and Wine Enthusiast went 90 point. which is exactly where I’m going to end up. This is high quality juice for the mone. and the caliber of wine you’re just not going to find elsewhere in the wine world at this price. I’m on the lookout for Aussie wines no. more than ever before; this bottle confirms it’s a worthy hunt. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick. Costco item number: 136578.

2014 Château de Belcier Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"There are a lot of interesting aspects to this wine. First u. we reviewed the 2012 vintage two years ago (don’t remember seeing a 2013 at Costco but I may have missed it) and really enjoyed the wine rating it 88 points and we found it to be a great value for the price which was then $10. So I was of course happy to see it back in Costco stores again in the 2014 vintage. The price this year was $8.7. which is a bit less than last
tim. and retail seems to be around $1. so that’s a healthy Costco discount. Another interesting fact about this wine is that it is
comprised of 92% Merlot and 8% Cabernet.
Whether it’s Cabernet Fran. or Cabernet Sauvigno. it doesn’t state? I’m surprised the label wouldn’t specify but
from poking around onlin. I’m pretty certain it is Cabernet Franc. I think it tastes like a blend of Cab Franc
to. which is one of the top varietals along with Merlot grown in Castillon. The 2012 vintage we tasted even included a
small amount of Malbec which was left out this year. And one of the coolest parts to the wine is that the
vineyards are adjacent to St Emilion so you are essentially getting St Emilion
fruit without the nam. hence the lower than normal price. A wine like this labeled as being from St
Emilion would likely be $25+. The wine pours dark with subtle oak and dark berries on the
nose; flavors are mostly dark frui. blackberr. blueberry with dark chocolate
notes; finishes stron. dry with black pepper; the finish this year seems to be
a little stronger than I noted in the ’12 vintage. 2014 was also a good growing year throughout most of Bordeaux so that’s always a bonus. Lots to like here for under $10. Côtes de Bordeaux is an exciting region that is becoming more in the public eye recently. Here’s a great article from Wine Enthusiast on the area with some other wines to try produced in the areas nearby Castillon. The Château Chantemerle from Blaye mentioned in the story is an amazing bu. especially that ’15 vintage if you see it around. Back to this win. I’m going up a point to 89 this year. I just don’t see many good reds under $10 that drink like this one. The fact it has a touch of age on i. makes it even more fun.

2017 Acrobat Pinot Gris,"The Acrobat Pinot Gris is produced by Oregon’s King Estate
and is a Costco staple this time of the year. The reason for the timing? Well
perhaps because it’s the perfect summer bottl. and it’s priced at only $10.99. We’ve reviewed many prior vintages of the Acrobat Pinot Gri. the last of which was the 201. which Erin made the following comment about: “The soft and supple mouthfeel is held up by a zippy acidity and mineral core. The finish is clean and easy.” She gave it 88 points. My thoughts on the 2017 vintage are almost exactly in line;
in fact my tasting notes (which I made without re-reading her prior review)
match almost exactly. So that means the
quality of the wine is still hig. and the other good news is that Costco’s
price stayed the same at $10.99. That’s off a retail of around $1. so I love
the value Costco is bringing here. The wine is light yello. pretty clear on the pour. Nose is
tropical fruit with wet stone; zesty and racy in the mout. with lemo. lim.
orange peel and grapefruit flavors; good acidity and minerality; love the
finish that is crisp and refreshing. This is a very nice summer wine and an incredible buy at this price point. I scored this new vintage just as Erin scored the ’15 – a solid 88 point. and I’m going to put on our Top Picks lis. as the value here is second to none.

2017 Louis Jadot Chablis,"I always love finding Chablis at Costc. and the Louis Jadot
is one of those bottles that seems to appear frequentl. but this is the first
time I picked one up and tasted it. And
I’m glad I did. This is a solid wine for
$19.9. which is a nice discount from its $25 retail price elsewhere. The wine also pulled down some good ratings including a 91
from Suckling and 90 points from Wine Spectator. I’m going to fall right in line with them
too. The reason I love Chablis so much
is that it’s clean and pure expression of Chardonna. and the style really lets
the fruit come through; this bottle is a perfect example. Golden yellow on the pour with scents of peach and pear on
the nose; in the mout. flavors of lemo. peach and apricot with nice acidity; fantastic
dry finish with lingering minerality; there’s no crazy butter or oak on the
finish. This is clean and well executed
all around. This wine can pair with almost anything you want to throw at i. but seafoo. salads and cheese would all be ideal.

2015 Smith &amp; Hook Proprietary Red Blend,Smith and Hook are the names of two ranches that were replaced by namesake vineyards sometime in the late 70s before the Hahn couple bought the property.

2017 Zorzettig Sauvignon Blanc,I worked at a restaurant in New York that had an excellent Italian Sauvignon Blanc by the glass. I remember people’s reactions when they would try i. a mixture of surprise and deligh. and for this reason I would often recommend it.. A lot of people tend to associate Sauvignon Blanc with either grapefrui. freshly-cut gras. or gooseberry if you actually know what a gooseberry tastes like (I don’t). I also get a lot of bell or jalapeno pepper in these wine. especially those from New Zealand. Italian Sauvignon Blan. for the most par. is not like others. I think it tastes like a New World Bordeaux blend or even just some other exotic white grape that I’m not familiar with. The proper name of the region from which these grapes are grown is Friuli Venezia Giuli. and it’s located in North-Easternmost Italy at what would be the top right of the boot bordering both Austria and Slovenia. The DOC for this wine is Friuli Colli Oriental. famous for the white Friulano grape wines and popular for Pinot Grigio.. The front label of this wine is very simpl. with only the producer’s nam. “wine of Friuli” in Italia. and “Sauvignon.” Because there are other white grapes that begin with the name Sauvigno. I had to look the DOC up to make sure that it was in fact Sauvignon Blanc. Italian wine as well as Italian wine labels are about as confusing as an investment account statemen. so my advice is to just Google the DOC to find out what grapes are used for that particular designation. This wine pours a very light straw color in the glass and has aromas of ripe lemo. jasmin. and peach. One the palat. crisp acidity is well-balanced and the wine finishes with a pithy quality that was off-putting at first. There is a lot of herbaceousness and zest in the finish as well. I really enjoyed this win. and it was great on its own but would really shine with the right food pairing. I’ve been told before that when it comes to Italian wine and food pairings that it’s best to match the wine to the food that is popular in that area. Popular dishes from Friuli include white asparagus (very unlike the green asparagus that you are familiar with and a must-try if you ever have the fortune to find it in season. cherry gnocch. Jamar chees. and smoked trout.. I would personally recommend pairing this wine with a variety of fresh shellfish and grilled fish dishes. The lemon and zest of the wine will really compliment seafood dishes. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 Points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick. Alcohol: 13. Costco Item Number: 134982. Purchased in Bufor.

2016 Chateau Ste. Michelle Indian Wells Merlot,This wine has been a Costco staple for a whil. and it seems to come and go along with other varietals in the line.. I’ve seen the Indian Wells Cabernet and Chardonnay at time. and the wines are usually in the wooden bins on the tables. At $13.9. it’s one of those wines that could go in the aisles or with the bigger ticket items. Indian Wells refers to the Eastern Washington vineyards from which these grapes are sourced. These vineyards lie in the Wahluke Slope and Horse Heaven Hills AVAs. Some of the grapes are sourced from Chateau Ste Michelle’s Cold Creek Vineyards as well.. The vineyards were selected for producing “high qualit. ripe frui. yielding wine with intense color and flavo.” according to the wine’s tech sheet. Wahluke Slope Syrah was added (16%) to the Merlot (84%) in order to enhance the mouthfeel and rich fruit character. I tend to think of Washington reds as being very fruit-forward and low in tannin. If you like smooth and fruity wine. you should try some wines from this state. Merlot is a grape that tastes completely different depending on where it’s grown and how it’s vinified.. South American Merlot has a lot of blueberry and black licorice notes whereas Right Bank Bordeaux blend. predominantly Merlo. are usually earth and mineral driven with more of a floral quality. This wine does in fact have intense color like the tech sheet describes. A nice aroma of dark berries and milk chocolate fill the glass while the palate is smooth with black plum. vanill. and baking spice.. Everything is really well balance. and this is a fruit-forward wine without being swee. per se. I would drink this wine on its ow. but it could also pair well with a summer barbecue or chocolate-based desser. amongst other fare.. Wine Spectator gives this vintage 89 points and calls it “livel. with zesty frui. offering appealing black curran. espress. and spice flavors that finish with refined tannins.”. Previous vintages have received 90 points from both Wine Enthusiast and Wine Spectato. so I think that it’s safe to say that this is a consistently good-quality product.

2018 Craggy Range Te Muna Sauvignon Blanc,"Here’s an interesting New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc that we
found at our Costco for $16.9. which is more than we usually pay for wines
like thi. so we wanted to see what it was all about. Initiall. and upon a quick glanc. we thought this was the
more typical Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand’s popular Marlborough region. But on closer inspection of that cursive

which is an exciting region that produces some great Pinot Noir. If you’ve never tasted wines from Martinboroug.
I think you will want to start to look for them mor. especially after you try
this bottle. This wine pours pale yellow in the glas. with a nose of
wheatgrass and citrus fruit. Nice
acidity that was not overbearing as some New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs can
get. So to that exten. this style is
much more food friendly across a wider range of cuisine. Flavors of aprico. white peac. green apple and pineapple;
very nice finish that is slightly sweet and lingering with a touch of
honey. This is one of the more expensive
New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs that we’ve purchased recently but also one of the
best. There’s a lot to like here. Big ratings too from the critics as you can see here (90+ ratings across the boar. and for every vintage. along with a retail price of $2. so Costco is as usual around 20% below that..

2017 Firesteed Pinot Noir Willamette Valley,Finding a goo. dependable and affordable every day Pinot Noir is a serious challenge. Whether you go to Franc. New Zealan. or the U. good luck finding one that’s fun to drink and under $15. This Firesteed bottle just might be the one though. Thank you Costco. Retail price is around $1. but Costco is delivering this one for the rock bottom basement price of only $10.4. which seems hard to believe given the quality of this juice. We started falling in love with this wine last yea. and awarded it 90 points and put the wine on our Top Picks list. I had several readers write in and agree that it was a rar. value price. and very good Pinot Noir. We’re happy to see the price stay the sam. and expect this one to sell through pretty fast. The wine pours on the lighter side for a Pino. pretty easy to see through it; nose of spicy cherr. black cherry and perfume. The wine is medium in body and spicy; more cherry and dark berry flavo. col. nicely balanced and easy drinking. It’s rather simpl. as we noted last year to. but well presented. Nice finish that lingers for a bit. This wine isn’t going to blow you away in the realm of Pinot but for $1. it’s exactly what you want it to be – an eas. fun and very affordable Pinot for any occasion.

NV Casa Farvive Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore DOCG,I love the shape of this bottle. It’s short and fat and looks like the top-half of a magnum. Perhaps not the best fit to store on a wine rac. but this type of wine can be stored upright for years without compromise. I don’t personally recommend storing this wine for year. however. I usually head straight to the large display of purple-labeled Kirkland Prosecco for my everyday sparkling wine needs. I rarely drink Prosecco by itself because I love mimosas. For this reaso. I don’t much care for the subtle nuances of these wines since I’m muting them with orange juice. That being sai. I am glad that I picked up this wine because I thoroughly enjoyed it on its own. The mark of a good Prosecco is one that is well-balanced in sweetness and acidity with a finish that is crisp and clean. This wine is “Extra Dr.” which is deceivingly not the most dry category of sparkling wine. Prosecco is made from the Glera grap. high in acidit. and needs a bit of residual sugar to keep everything balanced. If you want a bone-dry Prosecc. howeve. look for “Brut” on the label. This wine is a step up from your everyday mimosa Prosecco. The Valdobbiadene province is touted for producing more concentrated wines than those simply labeled “Prosecco DOC.” which can use grapes from any of a number of areas within Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. I got a lot of crisp green apple on the nose and palate with notes of white peach and fresh flowers. This wine is perfect for summer and would pair well with a variety of appetizers. In Ital. Prosecco is often consumed as an aperitivo (prior to the meal) with finger foods. The wine is often mixed with Aperol or Campari in order to make a spritz.. If you’ve never tried one of these cocktail. I recommend doing so this summer. You want to use about an ounce and half of either of the aforementioned bitter liquors and pour it over ice. Then you simply top with 3-4 oz. of Prosecco and garnish with an orange slice. I will definitely pick up another bottle of this wine when I see it again. The price was more than fair at $10.99 per bottl. and I much prefer this to the next competing Prosecco mega-brand at the same price. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 Points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick.

2016 Ben Marco Malbec,This wine is on sale until June 9thin select Costco clubs. I have seen wine sales extend past the date given on the sign. so it is possible that it will remain on sale for longer.. The current sale price is $9.9. with a $4 discount from the regular $13.99 price. Because I like a good Malbe. and love a good sal. purchasing this was a no-brainer for me. The Malbec comes from Valle de Uco in Mendoza. This area is high-elevation and gets substantial sunlight. I love wines from high-elevation vineyards because they tend to display a complexity and bright fruit character that some wines lack.. War. sunny days and cool nights allow for extended hang-time which allows the fruit to really develop without passing the peak of physiological ripeness. High-quality Bordeaux varietal wines from Argentina are arguably some of the best wines in the world and often at very fair prices. While this wine is not what I would call top-tie. it is easily a mid-range Malbec and one that could pass at a restaurant for $12 per glass. It pours very dark purple and has pungent aromas of ripe black fruit. vanill. and cinnamon. There is a floral quality to the wine as well. The juice is made from 100% Malbec that has undergone complete malolactic fermentation which can round out a red wine and give it a smoother mouthfeel. After a period of time resting on its lees with frequent batonag. the wine is aged in 100% second-use French oak.. This is why I pick up so much cinnamon on the nose. Moderate tannin and subtle acidity make this good to drink on its own or pair with food. Recommended food pairings include medium-intensity cheese. sausage. and Bolognese. This wine is a good value at $13.99 and somewhat of steal for $9.99. If you are a Malbec fa. definitely try to get out and pick up a few of these before the sale potentially ends.

2015 Bodega Norton Privada Family Blend,We are always fans of the Norton Malbec that you frequently find gracing Costco’s shelves for only $12.  It’s super consistent year to year and hard to beat for the price. Here’s Norton red blen. that is still dominated by Malbec (40%. but brings in 30% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and we found it to create a more robust and complex wine that is certainly worth paying a couple more bucks for.

Als. it’s worth noting the super high scores for this win. including a 95 from James Suckling and a 94 from Wine &amp; Spirits.  So naturally I was interested to see what was inside the bottle. Turns ou. this is a very delicious win. pretty much on par with what I expected.  Super dark on the pour with aromas of dried black frui. pepper and espresso. Flavors of dark frui. blackberr. black cherry and pomegranate with mild metallic notes and nice acidity.  Into the finish is a bit of campfire smokiness with an ultra dry finish that lingers forever.  Love the finish on this wine. Overal. I’m a fan and the price is right.  Is this a 95 point wine?

2017 Kirkland Carneros Pinot Noir,We reviewed this wine last yea. and it’s one that I was excited to see again. A $10 Carneros Pinot Noir is one that I’m not likely to pass up. I compared my photos from the last vintage to the 2017 labe. and the two bottles are nearly identical. The only change that I could discern was the vintage and alcohol content. This year’s offering has 1% lower alcohol than previous. This may be due to the fact that winemakers had to pick early-ripening grapes like Pinot Noir and Chardonnay sooner than usual on account of apocalyptic wildfires.. Less hang time means lower sugar in the grape. which translates to less alcohol in the finished wine. In spite of thi. the vintage did not suffer quality-wis. and this wine is a testament to that. I personally prefer the lower-alcohol 2017 bottle to last year’s. This wine has a lot of juicy cherr. wild strawberr. and rhubarb flavors with aromas of vanilla and mushroom. Medium-bodied and with a moderate finis. the juice might pass for something twice the price. This is one of the Kirkland wines that I would purchase again for the value (read: hoard). I noticed during a recent visit to one of the busier Costcos in the Atlanta Metro Area that this particular stack of wine was approaching a thin strip of only a few cases.. If you were on the fence about trying this Pino. sit no longe. for it will be gone soon and we will have to wait until the 2018 vintage is released..

2017 Bodegas Muriel Pazo Cilleiro Rias Baixas Albariño, I’ve found a few new whites on my last couple trips to Costc. and love to put them in the mix as an alternative to Sauvignon Blancs and Chardonnays.

Also note the Wine Enthusiast 90 point score which I think is dead on for this bottle. In the glass this wine is a light yello. with stone fruit on the nose and aromas of white cake; flavors of peac. lemon and grapefruit in the mouth; this wine is tarty and sour with a great lingering finis. perfect for summertime. With the growing popularity of Albariño it’s getting harder and harder to find bottles of this caliber from Rias Baixas priced under $15.

2018 Kirkland Signature Cotes De Provence Rose,This wine tends to move quickly once it hits the aisles at Costco. This is not surprising considering it’s an $8.99 Provence Rose. These wines are almost always at least $12 per bottle. Apart from tha. this wine is consistently approachable and a good value. The perfect light-salmon color is appropriate for Spring and all of the occasions in which one would want a pink wine. The nose on this wine is quite aromatic. I immediately imagine the wild strawberries that I used to see growing in the Smoky Mountains when my family would go backpacking. At the same tim. I can also imagine sitting next to a rocky cliff by the sea. There is a very mineral quality to the wine as well as slight salinity. On the palate the wine is dry and clean. There’s a little heat up front even though the wine has only 12.5% alcohol. The alcohol is definitely prevalent. I get a lot of white peach and notable sweet citrus fruits like Meyer lemon. All of this is held up by a strong mineral backbone. This wine would pair well with raw shellfish or grilled meats like pork and chicken. I have always preferred to pair rose’ with spicy Thai food and fried calamari. This is one that you will not want to sit on. Drink it this yea. actuall. because the fresh fruit quality will only start to decline as the wine ages. This being sai. I always advise people not to purchase a rose’ vintage that is two years older than the current year. There are exceptions to this rul. of cours. but generally speakin. rose wines are released very soon after bottling and do not age well. Last yea. the price rose slightly to $9.49 from the previous $8.99 cost of the 2016 vintage. This yea. at least in my local clu. the price was back to $8.99. So that’s nice. Don’t hesitate to stock up on this if it sounds like something you’d drink throughout the summe. because as I mentioned befor. it probably won’t last for long.

2014 Kirkland Signature Rioja Reserva,I know a lot of you have been waiting for the next vintage of the Kirkland Rioja to arrive in Costco store. and for us to review it.  This is always one of our most anticipated Kirkland offerings of the yea. largely because of the ridiculously low price of only $6.99. At that price poin. there just isn’t a lot of competition in terms of goo. everyda. very drinkabl. robust red wines.  But this is that rare bottle that fits the bil. and the new 2014 vintage hitting stores now is every bit as good as year’s past. Let’s take a quick look back at our ratings on the previous vintages of this wine. 2010 Kirkland Rioja: 88 point. 2012 Kirkland Rioja: 87 point. 2013 Kirkland Rioja: 88 point. The tasting notes between all the different vintages are pretty similar and that’s a theme that carries on into the new 2014 vintag. which I’m going to give 88 points. It’s right in line with what I expecte. and remains an insane value buy for $7.  If you’re looking for other good Costco wine value. check out this round up we published recently of solid picks under $10.. This year’s Kirkland Rioja has that signature Rioja smell all over the nos. and you immediately know what you’re getting into.  Fruit is predominantly re. strawberry licoric. cherr. a bit of pepper and spice; feels great in the mout. nice and soft since it has a little age built into it.  Drinking perfect right now. I’ve tasted a lot of Riojas in the past 2 years as we worked on our Spanish wine book.  I can say that I haven’t tasted anything in this price range that comes close to this bottle.   I did find it perhaps a little light on the flavor and punch that you would get out of a higher priced Rioj. but there’s still so much to like at this price point.  Stock up while you can.

Lucien Albrecht Cremant d’Alsace Brut,I thought this would be a fun bottle to try. I love both bubblies and wines from France’s Alsace regio. which is located right on the border with Germany. To add a feather in the ca. this wine was also #71 on Wine Enthusiast’s Top 100 wines of 2018. They rated it 91 points. Costco is selling this wine for $19.9. which is fair as retail is $25 but I found it online for $17-18 so it would be nice to see it land at Costco for around $15. The big question here for fans of bubblies like this is how does this wine compare to the Kirkland Signature Champagne which is the exact same price at Costco (and a favorite of ours). Let’s get into this wine first. The Lucien Albrecht Cremant d’Alsace is a Blanc de Blancs (made entirely of white grapes) and in this cas. it’s 100% Pinot Blanc which is common for wines from Alsace.. It’s straw yellow on the pour with a little stone fruit on the nose; citrus. fresh and crisp in the mout. I picked flavors of green appl. lemon and orange peel. There’s a little cream and nutty almond in the finish. Nice effervescence. Be sure to drink it col. but not too cold. Pulling it right out of the fridge is a little too cold and it masks some of the flavor. After about 15 minutes at room tem. the flavors really started to come through. I think an ideal temp for bubbly is around 45-50 degrees F. Compared to the Kirkland Champagn. this wine is a tad sweeter; both my tasting partner and I made the same comment. This bottle isn’t overly swee. it’s just not as dry as the Champagne; I really did enjoy both wine. and am going to score this one almost the same as the KS Champagne that I awarded 90 points.

2016 Mosquita Muerta Sapo de Otro Pozo Blend de Tintas,"That headline sounds pretty complicate. but it really
shouldn’t be. Put simpl. this is a $20 Argentinian
red blend comprised of 60% Malbe. 20% Syrah and 20% Cabernet Franc. And it’s really good. The first thing you notice with this one is the heft of the bottl. that seems to weigh about twice as much as a standard bottle. And the wine inside is hefty too. This is a bi. dark red wine that is also subtle and elegant thanks to the inclusion of a few additional varietals.

2014 Seborio de Barahonda Nirea Yecla,Yecla is a sometimes overlooked region in Southeastern Spain that consistently delivers good value priced wine. predominantly made up of the Monastrell grape (which is the ame as Mourvedre).. But it’s an area that should certainly be on the radar of red wine fans looking for bang for their buck. This bottle is a perfect case in point priced at Costco for only $7.99. The blend is 60% Monastrell and 40% Garnach. and the wine is just delicious for the money; a perfect everyday table bottle for almost any cuisine. The wine is light purple in the glas. almost see throug. round cherry nose and medium in body. It’s simple and clean in the mout. no funk throughout..

2016 Bellavista Aresti Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon,Another screaming buy for under $1. I was excited to dig into this wine. This is another one of those wines that I know I’ve read about somewher. and made a mental note to remember i. so I would try it sometime. And that time is now. At $7.99 it’s a bargain; that’s off of the retail price around $1. and you can still find it online hovering around Costco’s price. But it doesn’t matter that Costco’s not bringing it in at a little more of a competitive price. This is a solid bottle for $. and that’s hard to find for a Cabernet. Medium purple in colo. slightly see throug. it was lighter than I expected. Lighter in body to. very much medium bodied; but the flavor packed it in; it’s juicy and young on the nose. All I could think was a freshly opened jar of Juicy Juice. Flavors were cherr. black raspberr. and strawberry licorice. The wine was pleasant and evened out with a little air; it’s simpl. easy and delicate; finishes mil. nicely done on this one across the board. James Suckling went 91 point. which is proudly displayed on the bottle neck. It was a little simple for me to go that hig. but I think it’s a solid 88 point win. and a big time value buy for those looking for a goo. very drinkable red under $10.

Costco’s price was $38.9. which is well below the retail of around $50 which is what I saw this bottle going for most everywhere else I looked. I knew I was getting a good price on i. but what I wanted to find out is whether the step up in price yielded the type of high quality wine you would expect.  And this bottle turned out to be exactly what I hoped it would be – it’s a delicious wine deserving of its price ta. and it surprised me for what a Malbec could deliver. Super dar. vampire-looking juice on the pour; spicy and peppery on the nose with dried dark fruit.

2017 Wines of Substance Columbia Valley CS Cabernet Sauvignon,So happy to see this bottle back in stock at Costco in the new ’17 vintage. The ’15 vintage was really amazing for only $12.99 and I gave it 89 points last year. The ’16 vintage scored huge among the critics so I’m bummed that one didn’t appear at my Costcos (Dunnuck 93; Wine Advocate 90-93; Suckling 92; Wine Spectator 90 points). The bottle just seems to pull down 90 points ratings like no other $13 bottle I’ve ever seen. It’s no wonder that this bottle makes frequent appearances on a number of “Best of” and “Best Value” lists. And the wine really is that goo. especially for those who like the bi. dark Cabernets of Washington State. The winemaker here is Charles Smit. who makes a number of popular WA State wines. His K Syrah is absolutely spectacula. and on the budget sid. his Ku Fu Girl Riesling is dynamite for $10. Dark on the pou. thick and intimidating in the glass; nose brings fresh juicy berrie. herbs and eart. leading into more dark frui. blackberrie. blueberries and chocolate notes; firm tannins with a lasting finish. This is a wine you wouldn’t balk at paying twice as much for. If you look elsewhere including onlin. this bottle is consistently in the $16-$18 range so Costco’s $13 price point is hard to beat. If you already like Washington State red. this is a no brainer. Stock up. If you’re still feeling your way around the region (and you should because there’s a lot of value to be found like this. you can’t pass this bottle up. I liked it a touch more than I remember the ’15 so am going to pump it up a point to a well deserved 90 points. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 point. Costco item number: 100178.

2014 Grifoll Declara Predicat Priorat,Here’s a really interesting bottle that showed up in my Costco and caught my eye. It’s a wine from Spain’s premier Priorat region that is only $12.99 (most bottles from here are $30+). So I was a bit skeptical but wanted to test it so I could report back to you what I found. In shor. this is an amazing buy. Online the bottle ranges from $15-$2. so Costco’s price is pretty good. And the wine inside is equally tast. drinking really good right now with five-ish years of age on it. This is not the big sexy Priorat bottle that you often find from this region (and pay for it too). Instead this is a quality red blend at a great price. It’s comprised of Garnatxa Negra (another name for Grenache. Carigna. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlo. aged for 10 months in French oak. There are various percentage breakdowns of the varietal makeup onlin. but I couldn’t find a clear consensus among them. I’m guessing very heavy on the Grenache and Carignan. The wine needed a little air to come together so keep the swirling going. The wine is ligh. almost see through on the pou. showing early signs of a little age around the edges. The nose is an interesting combination of spices and wet rock. The wine is medium plus in body with dried red and dark fruit flavors; spicy cherr. plum and blueberr. a dry finish that is super lasting. Quite a remarkable value here for under $15; it’s kind of an outlier in a league of its own. Wine Spectator went 90 points on this win. and I’m pretty clos. but think I’m going to come in just below at 89 points. For the mone. this is probably one of the better Costco wine values of the past six to nine months. It’s just not easy to find good quality juice priced this low. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 89 point.

2015 Migration Russian River Chardonnay,What a steal for an excellent and perfectly balanced Russian River Chardonnay. I loved this bottle. It’s no surprise that Duckhorn is the brand behind it. Costco’s price is $17.99. Google it and it’s around $30 just about everywhere else (retail is $32). Combined with solid 90 point ratings from all the critic. this is shaping up to be one of the better under $20 white wine buys I’ve come across from Costco this year. The wine pours a golden bronze in the glass and offers citrus and stone fruit aromas on the nose along with hints of butterscotch and vanilla. It’s medium in bod. with aprico. peach and green apple flavor; very clean delivery of the fruit; not too much oak or butter; more Burgundian in style which I really like compared to the huge butter and oaky Chardonnays that seemed impossible to get away from for a while.

2016 Kirkland Signature Oakville Napa Cabernet Sauvignon,The Kirkland Oakville Cabernet is always a bottle we look forward to trying every year. We’re coming right off the heels of reviewing the latest vintage of the Kirkland Rutherford Cabernet which is produced just up the roa. and Erin went 89 points on that wine. Last yea. I went 91 points for the Oakville Cab and noted that it was probably one of the best vintages of the wine that I had tasted. And this 2016 vintage is right there and another example of why it is so much fun buying wine at Costco. Most Oakville Cabernet will run you $30-$40 and way up from there. This one comes in under $20 and could easily pass for a wine that cost twice as much. Note: our friends over at ILikeThisGrape just published a beautiful book called DRIVE THROUGH NAPA all about the appellations within Napa including Rutherfor. Oakvill. Stag. etc. It’s a fun read and you can learn a ton for only $10. Alrigh. let’s get into the wine. On the nose is pomegranat. clove and spice; super juicy in the mout. medium to full in body; flavors of dark frui. blackberr. boysenberr. plu. notes of anis. a touch of mocha towards the finish which is super dry. This is a very nice package throughou. true to its appellation and an excellent buy for the price. As we’ve noted in year’s pas. the back of the label lists Glenn Hugo as the winemake. who also produces Napa Cabernet for Girard. Napa Cab fans will find a lot to like her. especially at this price ($18.99). I’m going 90 point. one point less than last year but one higher than we went on the Rutherford.

2014 Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte Le Petit Haut Lafitte,I love the wines of Bordeau. particularly those on the left bank and increasingly more the area south of the city of Bordeau. Pessac Leognan. In fac. Pessac might be one of the best places to go among the top Bordeaux regions if you’re looking for the biggest bang for the buck. Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte is situated in an ideal locatio. not far from other top Pessac estates like Chateau Haut-Baill. Domaine de Chevalie. and the famed Haut-Brion.. One thing to note about Bordeaux wines is that the estates will often produce second or third wine. in addition to their premier estate wine.  These second and third offerings are typically lower price. and a little less desirable just because they tend to use fruit from younger vines.  But they still can be quite good. The estate bottles can cost 2-3X as much or mor. so getting into the other offerings is much more accessible to a wider range of wine drinkers. For today’s review we’re looking at the second wine from Smith Haut Lafitte that I found at Costco for $27.89. That’s a pretty crazy price as I’ve seen this wine for $37 at a big box wine shop.  The estate wine from Smith Haut Lafitt. depending on the yea. is going to run around $10. maybe more. In my cella. I just happened to have an estate wine of the same vintage as the second label bottle from Costco; so although this is going to be a costly experimen. I thought it would be fun to drink them side by sid. note any difference. and really see if the estate wine is worth 4X the price. The short answer is yes. The estate wine is worth 4X the price. But that doesn’t mean the Le Petit is a bad buy. For the pric. I thought it was an excellent wine. It just doesn’t have the power and depth of the estate bottle. The wines look similar in the glass but once I gave them a snif. it became apparent the estate bottle was in a league of its own. In the mout. the flavor profiles were simila. dark frui. blackberr. plum and ceda. but the power behind the estate bottle was unmistakable. Le Petit held it’s own thoug. and outside of being consumed next to its big brothe. I feel the wine can stand up pretty good to most other bottles in the $20-$40 price range. It’s certainly ready to drink now or in the next few year. as the estate wine can (and probably should) go for another 10+ years. So that’s another benefit of these second label wines. The finish was nice and fairly long on the Le Peti. but the estate wine really dug in and held on for the long haul. Overal. I’m a huge fan of both wine. and they are both super fair for their price points. If you want an entry into the wines of Bordeaux and Pessa. the La Petit is an excellent choice. When you want something specia. the estate bottle is just to die for (and I have a feeling the next vintage. 2015-2016 will be even better). So there you have it. Is the estate wine worth 4X the price? Ye. it really is that good. Is the Le Petit second label a good buy at Costco for $28? Absolutel. and I’m going 90 points and will be adding it to the Top Picks list. If I had to rate the estate win. I’d probably be in the 93-94 point range. It’s something special.

2014-2015 Castello di Monsanto Chianti Classico Riserva,"How ironic is this?  Just a few days ago I posted a Cellar Series review of the 2012 Monsanto Chiant. a bottle I’d been cellaring for couple of years to see how it would taste later. It was delicious and confirmed my feelings that the Monsanto Chianti is just a solid buy year to yea. and one that can even get a little better with some age. At the end of the review I noted that the 2012 was the last vintage of Monsanto that I’d seen in Costc. and it’d been two years.  Until the other da. when much to my surpris. did I not only find Monsanto Chianti at my Costc. but I found two vintages along with a price drop down to $17.9. from $20. Boo. bought both vintage. the 2014 and the 201. the latter of which received 96 points from James Suckling and 94 points from Wine Spectator.  The 2014 scored some low 90 ratings to. but the 2015 is really looking like the killer buy.  So I tried them both side by side to help guide you in which one to buy. The short answer is they are both excellent wines.  If you’ve enjoyed Monsanto Chianti in the pas. then you will be very pleased with either one of these vintages. Perhaps I’m a little jadded by the critic ratings because I did see them in advanc. but the 2015 is a clear notch abov. and definitely the bottle you want to buy.  I’d hunt through the bin to grab the ’15s.  And ’15 was a monster vintage in Italy. Both wines look similar in the glas. dark and ric. and they are packed with spicy black cherry and black currant; savory and pepper. dry with a long finish; the 2015 vintage brings depth and layers that are noticeable when you taste them side by side; more elegance and softness to the tannins. Definitely deserving of a couple additional points. I should have bought another 2015 for the cella. as I think it will develop nicely.  Based on our experience drinking the 2012 vintage after seven year. I would guess this 2015 would be really something special in 2022.  But it’s drinking just fine today.

2014 Robert Mondavi Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon 1.5L,This is an absolute screaming buy if you’re able to find it at your Costco.  We posted about the big bottles arriving in Nov for the holidays.  At that tim. this bottle was priced at $100.  Today it can be had for half that. The price on the standard size Mondavi Oakville at Wine.com is $5. and the critics loved this win. giving it 90+ points across the board.  I was a huge fan of ’12 and ’13 Napa Cab. and am starting to really enjoy the ’14. which will also show a lot of potential down the line after a few more years. . In fac. scoring an Oakville Cab like this in the big bottle is perfect for the cellar (less air/wine contact ratio due to large format. and will be really exciting to pull out in 10 or more years.  That sai. it’s drinking pretty good right now too. Let’s get into the wine itself.  The blend has a few other varietal. made up of 88% Cabernet Sauvigno. 5% Cabernet Fran. 3% Malbe. 3% Petit Verdot and 1% Merlot. Right away on the nose you can tell this is high quality Napa juice.  I just love these Oakville wines; flora. vanilla aromas with big frui. cherr. black currant and plum; full in body with cedar and espresso on the finish.  A lovely wine. As you can see in the photo abov. the Sequoia Grove Cabernet in the 1.5L bottle was right next to this Mondavi.  That’s another screaming deal that’s normally $40 for a standard size bottle.

2016 Seghesio Sonoma Zinfandel,The Seghesio Zinfandel is just a joy to taste every year.  It’s consistent and interesting and one of those Costco bottles that I look forward to arriving in the store.

In the glass the wine pours pretty ligh. see throug. and in the mouth it’s medium to medium plus in body.  Great aromatic. but where this one shines is once it hits the palate. Loads of flavo. blueberry pie and boysenberr. milk chocolate and pepper on the finish.  This wine is fresh and fruit forward with tones of heft.  It’s a Zin for Cab and Merlot lovers who think they don’t like Zin. (Anything from Ridge falls into this category too). Costco’s price tag of $20.89 is pretty good and about what you’ll find online; retail is closer to $26.  Wine Spectator went 93 points which is pretty crazy.  I’m not going that hig. but I will put a Highly Recommended badge on this bottle.  It’s worth every bit of $20. Last time we reviewed this win. I gave it 90 point. but I feel this vintage is a step up from there.  Note the price has been gently climbing up too as I’m sure this is becoming a more popular wine as more people have a chance to taste it.

2017 Zuccardi Concreto Malbec,We’ve been tracking the Costco wines that were listed on Wine Spectator’s top 100 wines of 2018 lis. but this Zuccardi Malbec jumped out to me because it was featured as the #10 wine on a similar Best of year list from Wine Enthusiast. Plus there were a slew of low to mid 90 point ratings for the wine from just about everyon. including a 96 point rating from Suckling.  And Costco’s price seemed pretty reasonable at $27.9. well below retail of $38 and online for $34. And now digging into i. I really wish I had bought more.  This really is a delicious wine that lives up to the hype from the high ratings.  The wine is young and fres. filled with life and energy; just a lot of fun to drink no. and I’m hoping I’m able to buy a few more as I think it will be fun to see it develop after a few more years. I picked up a combination of red and dark frui. blackberry with spicy cherry; some earth and herbs; super acidi. this wine really grips the cheeks and holds on; bone dry finish. Quite remarkable how good this is drinking so very young. This is a really impressive effort that blew my expectations through the roof.

2014 Chateau Palmer Alter Ego de Palmer,Chateau Palmer in the Margaux region of Bordeaux produces stunning wine. and this is the most affordable jumping off point into their wines that you’re going to find. The Alter Ego is priced at $59.99 at Costc. which is about $5 less than most online outlet. and $15 less than I saw it at Total Wine. And although it’s not chea. it really is worth the splurge; I found it to be gorgeous all aroun. and even though it’s rather youn. many of the ’14 Bordeaux are drinking pretty good right no. this one being a case in point. The Alter Ego is a left bank win. but the blend is right bank Merlot based coming in at 52% Merlo. 32% Cabernet Sauvignon and 13% Petit Verdot. The nose begins with ripe fruit and soil; flavors of red berrie. raspberry and cherr. a little col. and spice; finishes as dry as can be; a great ride from nose to finish. Although it’s drinking great no. this one can definitely be laid down in the cellar for a few more years. I tasted an ’09 Alter Ego last month that was absolutely delicious. At the pric. I’d say this wine is drinking at least 2X its pay grad. particularly comparing to Napa wines in the $100-$125 range. And while this second wine from Chateau Palmer is amazin. I’ve tried several of their estate wines and they are even more layere. structured and complex; and with a price tag to go with it. If you’re looking for a special bottle this holiday seaso. you won’t do much better for the money than this Alter Ego from Chateau Palmer. I’m a big fan.

2015 Scott Paul La Paulee Pinot Noir Willamette Valley,Finding this Oregon Pinot from Scott Paul was a pleasant surprise that was stuffed in the middle of the cheap seats (the wine aisle. not the wooden boxes). This is a high caliber Pinot with a retail price of $4. a standard Costco price of $3. and then an absolutely insane limited time discount of $13 that gets you out the door for only $16.99. I didn’t think too hard about dropping a couple in my cart. And now that I’m digging into i. I can confirm what I had hoped would be the cas. that this bottle tastes much more like a wine that you find for its full retail price tag. The wine is a combination of fruit from several quality vineyard. including fruit from Oregon’s famed Dundee Hill. which is a favorite of mine. Hop on over to the Scott Paul website and you can dig further into their single vineyard bottlings of some of the same frui. and the price tag almost doubles. This wine hit me right all around. It’s ligh. see through in the glass; fresh aromas of vanilla and cola; beautiful in the mouth; cherr. col. black licoric. some plum; a touch of baking spice and pepper in the finish; really a well constructe. elegant wine that leaves you wanting to take another drink immediately. I can’t think of a Pinot Noir under $20 that I’ve enjoyed more than this (and it’s probably because it technically isn’t an under $20 win. but for us lucky Costco buyer. it has that special price for a little bit longer). If you see this one in your Costc. I’d recommend buying a few as I imagine these will go fast.. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick. Costco item number:106698. $16.9.

2014 Clos du Val Estate Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley,Clos du Val is a classic Napa producer and this 2014 bottle is just signatur. high quality Napa wine at a very special Costco price. But be ready to buy it if you see i. as the promo price is only good through the end of the year. As you can see Costco’s standard price of $42.99 is in itself pretty good for this bottl. especially considering Total Wine and Wine.com both sell it for $50. Now Costco’s bringing it down to $34.9. which is likely going to be hard to beat almost anywhere. It’s still not an inexpensive bottl. but this time of the yea. when you’re looking for something nice to bring to a Christmas party or want to impress one of your wine nerd friend. this is a pretty solid choice for the money. To that exten. if you’re looking to pay a little less for something nic. we just reviewed a lovely Barolo for $28 that was absolutely delicious too. Dark in the glass and huge in the mout. this is a bi. bold Cabernet that remains medium plus in body but is just packed with flavor; mostly dark frui. some black licorice and mocha surrounded by spices and cedar; strong powerful finish. This wine is just calling for a big juicy steak. 2014 was another great vintage in Nap. and I think this wine will only develop further with time. At this price with the steep discoun. this could be a good one to buy multiple bottles of and cellar them for a bit. I plan to buy a couple more if I see them again at Costco stores near me. I’ll try to hold on to them for another 5-7 years if they don’t get consumed before then. Another Top Pick for sure with this wine. That makes quite a string of winners so far in December.

2012 Kirkland Signature Ribera del Duero Gran Reserva,We’ve been hoping the Kirkland Ribera del Duero would hit stores soo. and what a nice little holiday trea. just like it was last year with the 2011 vintage. Look for the blue striped bands on the bottle’s neck and you’ll have no problem picking this one of the sea of Costco wines. This marks the second year for the Kirkland Riber. and it is every bit as good as the debut wine was a little over a year ago. The price bumped up $1 this year to $13.9. but it’s still an amazing value. I might say that even if I paid $20. This is one of those perfect “why I buy wine at Costco” example. access to Kirkland value buys from premier wine regions. The wine is 100% Tempranillo and carries the Gran Reserva aging designatio. which is the one you want. This means an extended aging period of 3-5 years in oak barrels and the bottle. To that exten. this wine is ready to drink no. but could also age for a bit more if you wanted (I still have a ’11 vintage in the cellar that I’ll open down the line for our Cellar Series). This wine is similar to the ’11 in style and qualit. and is made by the same producer in Spain. In the fine print on the back of the label you can see that this wine is produced byBodegas Vina Solorc. a well known estate in Ribera del Duer. whose lesser wines (non Gran Reserva) cost more than this one. Definitely give it a little decant to open up; the wine pours dark in the glass with slightly light edges indicating it has a touch of age on it. Nose of dried fruit; then sour cherr. nyquil/cough dro. a little anise and some oak towards the finish. Nice mouthfee. the wine is light but powerful. Spectacular mouth-coating finish that is ultra dry and lasts forever. This bottle is every bit as good as it’s been in year’s past. I’m keeping the rating consistent at 90 point. and highly recommend this one if you like red wine. particularly Spanish Rioja or Toro. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick.

2013 Casa E di Mirafiore Barolo,When browsing the wine aisles at Costc. you have to keep an eye out for wines like this Casa E di Mirafiore Barolo that are sometimes easy to miss alongside the Chianti and Brunello bottles they are frequently placed next to. Costco’s price was $28.9. which is fantastic for any Barol. and even better for a tasty one like this. Bounce over to Wine.com and you can see this wine would go for $38. It’s also worth noting the high scores for this wine across the boar. highlighted by a 96 point rating from Decanter. Indee. once I got into this on. it really is a beautiful wine at a price that’s hard to beat. In the glas. the wine is light and see through; Barolo is made from the Nebbiolo grape which looks similar to Pinot Noir in the glas. but it’s a grape that packs a ton of punch in the mouth. (if you want to take a deeper dive into the grapes and wines of Ital. feel free to check out our boo. Decoding Italian Wine). Really vibrant aroma. perfume and cherry on the nose; big as expected in the mouth with soft tannins and a good dose of acidity; flavors of sour cherr. plu. and strawberry rounded out by mocha and white chocolate notes towards the finis. which is bone dry. This is a delicious wine that paired perfectly with meatballs we prepared. It’s one of those ultra-versatile wines that really could pair with about anything. Improves with a little air; this is a nice buy on an elegant wine that feels (and tastes) like it should cost a bit more. We’ll be adding to our Top Picks lis. and if we get the chanc. might try to pop a couple in the cellar as I think they would really develop further in the years to come.

2012 Chateau Lynch-Bages Echo,Echo is the second bottle from Chateau Lynch-Bage. a Pauillac property that I’ve always been a big fan o. particularly their estate bottle. red and whit. that are absolutely spectacular. This is a good way to get a foot in the door though for a fraction of the price of the winery’s top bottles. Costco’s price was $36.99 which is really outstanding for this bottle. Searching onlin. I’m finding it everywhere from $45-$60. The blend is57% Cabernet Sauvigno. 33% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. When I’m looking to save a buck on good Bordeau. I’ll frequently opt for a nearby property’s first bottle instead of a well known property’s second bottle because often times they can be priced pretty similar. But with Lynch-Bage. and another good Costco pic. the Alter Ego from Chateau Palme. you are getting access to world class winemaking operations; often times the main difference is that the second bottles use grapes from younger vines on the estat. and often contain a bit more Merlot in the blend. I think this bottle is outstanding for the mone. and reminiscent of Bordeaux that cost twice as much. The wine is stinky on the nos. signature Bordeaux barnyard smell. It’s medium in bod. drinking really nice right now; gentle and soft in the mouth; red fruit flavor with a hint of dark chocolat. super dry and nice oak into the finish. For anyone wanting to explore the world of Bordeaux wine. this is a nice entry point for moving above that $20-$25 range. You really get a lot for the mone. and I’d say the incremental gain in quality between an inexpensive Bordeaux and this bottle is much bigger than jumping from this wine to the estate bottles. Highly recommende. and I’ll put this bottle on our Top Picks list. I also plan to add a couple of these to the cellar to try in a few more years. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 point.

2015 Ritual Pinot Noir,I liked the exaggerated curve of the Burgundy bottle as wel. a hint to the style of Pinot Noir inside. These kinds of bottles are nice for presentation but annoying in that they don’t fit well into wine racks. Although wines from Chile are classified as New Worl. I have always felt that these wine. while fruit-forwar. have similar nuances as those from European countries. Chilean wines are earth. dr. and often a bit green. Finding one that strikes the right balance between underripe funk and juicy fruit can be difficul. albeit rewarding. Ritual Pinot Noir is just that. The nose is intense and perfumed with col. cherr. vanill. and raspberry jam. Moderately intense on the palat. the flavor mimics the nose. The wine is a little tigh. however fine tannins hint that it will improve and further develop over the next few years. The juice inside this bottle is evidence of Old-World winemaking method. and the back label describes “planting each vine and hand harvesting in small batches” in the same manner as “some of the world’s greatest Pinot Noir.. You mean like Pinot Noir fro. oh sa. France. While the fruity nose is a dead giveaway of a New World win. you know you’re not in California when you drink a glass of this. The finish is different. It’s drier and a little more complex than others in this price range. Savory qualities and mineral notes echo the Old-World winemaking attempt. James Suckling gives this wine 93 point. which honestly doesn’t mean much to me but I felt the need to note it anyways. The average price for this bottle online is around $2. so the $15.99 Costco price tag is definitely a significant savings. If I were to still casually stroll the wine aisles of Costco and offer suggestions to member. this one would definitely be on my list. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 Points (a CostcoWineBlog Top Pick.

2017 Zolo Chardonnay Unoaked,I was happy to run into this Zolo Chardonnay from Mendoza at my Costco after hearing high praise for the wine from readers. At $7.99 the price was sure righ. and as it turned ou. the wine was amazing too. When Chardonnay is unoaked like thi. it really lets the fruit shine throug. and that’s exactly what we have here. This is the opposite side of the spectrum from the bi. buttery and woody Chardonnays you still seem to find a lot of. To that exten. it’s definitely a Chardonnay for white wine fans who don’t think they like Chardonnay. The wine pours a light golden yellow; the citrus fruit is pervasive right on the nose; I get a lot of aprico. appl. pineapple flavor; nice mouthfee. medium bodied and refreshing; the citrus fruit digs in through the finish with a touch of cream and vanilla to round things out. It’s hard to believe the price tag her. since from start to finish this is a really delicious wine. I only wish we had discovered this one earlier during the summer months as it would be the perfect wine for sitting on the beach or hanging poolside. If you can find i. I imagine you could stock up for next summe. if they don’t get consumed before then. This is not your typical Chardonnay; it almost shares more traits with some Sauvignon Blancs or an Albarino to a degree. And it’s worth mentioning that James Suckling went 93 points on this wine which is obviously really hig. and higher than I’ll g. but it speaks to the caliber of what we have in the bottle here.

Kirkland Signature wines are typically good values (although we’ve had a few skew the other way. but this Cotes du Rhone Village. similar to year’s pas. is once again a ridiculously good buy for only $6.99. Longtime readers will know this is one of the bottles we anxiously look for each yea. in hopes that it delivers the good. and then we move in and stock up for the wintertime. And that’s exactly what we plan to do. I’m enjoying this wine on a crisp Atlanta night as the weather begins to chang. with just a little Dubliner cheese (an equally good buy at Costco). And as I sit here enjoying this glas. I’m starting to think that I’m going to have to bump it up a point from past years; because for some reason this new ’17 vintage is really hitting me right. This wine is a classic Rhone GSM blend (Grenach. Syrah and Mourvedre) from a top name in the are. who’s listed on the back label. Patrick Lese. the winemaker her. has produced a number of wines in the Rhone area which can be viewed here. I would imagine this is among the least expensive in the portfoli. so it never hurts to have a pro behind the scenes especially when you’re paying $7. In Nap. $7 will get you little more than a mishmash of left over varietals from the outskirts blended together with a fancy label. Spic. peppery on the nos. classic Rhone wine; medium plus in bod. nice mouthfeel; mostly dark frui. blackberr. anis. dark chocolate notes; finish is spicy with pepper; and after a good decant everything came together a bit more cohesively. We went 87 points on the last vintag. with similar tasting note. but I’m going to bump it up to 88 this year with a solid Buy recommendation. This is some good juice for the money.

Although they are a Napa area staple (I frequently stop at the Gotts across the street for lunc. but haven’t made it to the winery yet. I always associated Merryvale with middle of the road wines. This Chardonnay is changing my perception. Next time I’m grabbing a burger across the stree. I plan to make my way over to the winery. Costco’s price is $23.9. which is quite a bit off the retail of $3. but I noticed K&amp;L (one the of the best online wine merchants) had it for $25 online. So Costco’s price is more than fai. and quite frankly well worth it for a wine of this complexity and dimension. Golden yellow on the pou. this wine has a little spice on the nos. and starts with big aromas of baked apple pie with cinnamo. into some green appl. lemon and lime flavors; it’s fairly hefty in the mouth leaning towards full in body; good acidity. The finish is dyno-mit. with a little bite and it sticks around forever. I know most people don’t decant white wine. but I’m going to recommend decanting this one. It really changed over the course of an hour from when I pulled the cork to when I had it poured in a few glasses with exposure. And the second round of pours released even more beauty. And the critics seems to agre. giving this one 90+ points across the board; the highest rating coming in at a whopping 94 points from Wine Enthusiast.

2015 Stonestreet Estate Vineyards Chardonnay Alexander Valley,I was super surprised to see this Stonestreet Chardonnay wine arrive in the bins at my Costco and at the highly discounted price of $25.99. Since retail on this wine is closer to $40-$45 that’s a steep Costco discount on a wine that I’ve had previously on two separate occasion. and absolutely loved it. This wine (vin. 2014 I think) was actually part of my local monthly wine club last year (ye. I think it’s important to support the small local guys too). Before tasting i. I passed it off at first as just another California Chardonna. expecting the usual overabundance of oak and butter masking most of the flavor. I couldn’t have been more wrong. This is a killer Chardonnay drinking way above its price ta. and the 2015 vintage follows suit. You can check out the wine’s historical ratings here on the Wine.com pag. and they are consistently in the low to mid 90’s which is beyond impressive. Wine Enthusiast really went bonkers for the 2015 vintage of this win. giving it 94 points and naming it an Editor’s Choice. So I guess the word is getting out. I’m surprised these are still lingering around particularly at such low prices. I’m going to scoop a few more up for sure if I can. Let’s get into it. The wine pours a golden yellow in the glass. Floral nose with spice note. a little orange peel and baked apple pie; flavors of green appl. pear and citrus fruit; medium plus in body with a long spicy finish; mineral notes lingering in the mouth. Just a super interesting wine drink after drink. White wine and Chardonnay fans need to be on the look out for this one. I have a feeling these are going to go fast once the word gets out.

2015 Walt Blue Jay Anderson Valley Pinot Noir,Super happy I tried this Walt Pinot Noir from Anderson Valley. It was $36.99 at my Costc. so I was really hoping for a great and memorable win. and that’s exactly what I found. Retail price on this bottle ranges from $40-$46 if you bounce between Wine.com and Wine Enthusiast; plus the latter gave the wine a nice 92 point rating. And I might fall right in that ball park. This is some impressive Pinot that is definitely a major step up in terms of complexity and depth from what you find in the $15-$20 range. There’s a lot going on right from the get go; the aromatics can be picked up several inches from the glass; all spic. nutme. a little smoke and anise; stick your nose deeper in the glass and the aromas are magnified. I was impressed from the start with this wine. In the mout. it’s a meaty and smoky Pino. loaded with character and heft that will attract fans of more robust red wines. So all you Cab/Bordeaux drinkers out ther. here’s a solid U.S. Pinot built just for you. That sai. there’s finesse to the presentation; flavors of blueberr. blackberr. black tea and cola; medium to full in body but lightly tannic. The real beauty here is the finish. It goes on and on. A beautiful lingering finish that is undeniable and clearly what I will remember most about this wine. Rockstar winemaker Kathryn Hal. proprietor of Hall Wine. is also the proprietor of Walt Wine. and as indicated on the back of the label she produces the Walt wine series in celebration of her parents of the same name. I’ve always enjoyed Hall wine. and now I have a whole new line to explore and enjoy. This is an instant addition to our Top Picks list. Sur. this wine isn’t cheap at $3. but is it worth it?

2016 Marcelle de Changey Puligny-Montrachet,I had a few readers in the forumsrequest reviews for Costco wines that are in the $30-$40 rang. so although many of our reviews focus on good bargain finds under $2. I’m going to try to sprinkle a few more expensive wines in the mix now and then. This white Burgundy jumped out at me right a way as a perfect candidate along these lines. It was priced at $41.9. which is fair for a wine from Puligny-Montrache. and I was a little surprised to see it in my Costco (it’s been quite a few years since we last reviewed a wine from this region). Puligny-Montrachet and and its neighbo. Chassagne-Montrache. are well known appellations in Cotes du Beaune with a reputation for producing fine Chardonnay; and that’s exactly what we have here.

Complex throughou. the nose starts with citrus frui. butte. and subtle oak; flavors of appl. orange with a touch of butter and vanilla towards the finish; medium in body with a little minerality and a crisp finish. The story here is really the balance; it’s hard to stop drinking this wine; it’s elegant and interesting every sip. Be sure to not over chill it though; pull it out of the fridge for 15 minutes before you serve i. or if you have a wine fridg. serve it right around the 55 degree cellar temp and you can really taste the nuances that can be masked by a wine that is served too cold. We didn’t pair this wine with any food; rather we enjoyed it while prepping a meal and didn’t intend for two of us to finish it off so quickly; but there are worse problems you could have. I think you can really could enjoy this wine with a wide range of cuisine including chicken dishe. salad. cheeses and almost any seafood. I’m a big fan and wish I had a cellar full of these bottles to enjoy more frequently; so if you’re looking for a nice Chardonnay to celebrate a special occasion or enjoy with a special mea. this is a great pick. And it’s one that I think will surprise people who find most Chardonnays to be too oaky and buttery. This is a perfect example of how great Chardonnay is made.

2016 Kirkland Signature Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,It’s been a little while since we got our hands on one of the Kirkland Columbia Valley offerings from Washington State. The last one was this 2015 Cab-Merlot blend that we thought was pretty goo. and before that we had to dig into the vaults to find this Columbia Valley Bordeaux blend we really enjoyed too. Now we get the straight Cab from the ’16 vintage and Costco’s price is only $8.9. which I’ll say up front here is a steal for a wine like this. There are a few Kirkland Cabs in stores right now to choose fro. including the Alexander Valley that we recently reviewed (good choice). I’ve also heard the new Kirkland Stags Leap is out there but I have yet to see it. But among the selection I’ve tasted in stores right no. this Columbia Valley bottl. for $9 might be the best choice. It’s some good quality juice at a really low price point. Ripe blueberries on the nos. with juicy frui. mostly dar. blackberr. blueberry with notes of anise and leather; deep lasting finish that is super dry. This wine drinks way above its pay grade. We paired with some meatballs (Costco ground beef + ground biso. delicious) on an overcast summer da. and it was a nice match. It’s a good one for a summer BBQ too. I love when the back of the label lists the winemake. which we learn in this case is Brandon Rice. A quick Google sleuth reveals he’s the winemaker at Wahluke Wine Compan. which is owned byMilbrandt (who has produced other Kirkland wines in the past). So we have a good team behind the scenes on this one. This is probably one of the better Kirkland wine buys floating around in stores right no. so I plan to scoop a few up to hold on to for the cooler months. I’m going to add to our Top Picks list because of the high quality to low price ratio. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 88 Point. Costco item number: 122684. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. G. Alc. 14.5.

2015 Joel Gott Cabernet Sauvignon,The Joel Gott Cabernet Sauvignon is a Costco staple. Every club that I’ve ever been to carries it. Some of them stock it in the wooden bins on what I like to call the “tables.” Other clubs prominently display pallets of it on their end caps. The price tends to always remain the sam. hovering somewhere between $13-$15 per bottle. I must say that I used to like this wine more. The 2013 vintage was really good. I still have a bottle or two left that I open from time to tim. and it has held well. Because each cuvee is blended from juice that comes from all over Californi. there are bound to be variations between vintages. The current release (2015) lists the appellation as “Californi.” followed by eight different areas such as Nap. Sonom. Montere. and Lodi. This wine i. in a wa. a tour-of-California Cabernet. The tech sheet explains that it “reflects what each appellation gives to the wine.. Whatever the reason given for using grapes from so many different area. the juice is good and ultimately I don’t judge the wine as being an overpriced and mass-produced California blend. It’s 100% Cabernet and still manages to be smooth and subtl. striking the right balance between tannic structure and dark berry flavors. This is a great wine to have on its own or with an appropriate Cabernet pairing (I’m looking at yo. Filet Mignon). Costco Filet Mignons are kille. by the wa. in both flavor and value. Aged in 25% new American Oa. which lends bolder flavors than French oak doe. hints of baking spices such as anise and clove mingle with subtle toasted coconut aromas. A core of dark berry and cassis precedes a lingering finish. The alcohol content is right where it should be at a friendly 13.9%. Too many California Cabernets these days are overly “ho.” with ABVs at 15% and up. I personally don’t like to see stars after drinking only one glass of wine. While I’m not hoarding bottles of the latest vintage like I was a couple of years ag. I would buy this wine again and be confident that I’m getting my money’s worth. Costco sells this brand at a price that’s well below most grocery stores and also manages to edge out competing wine retailers in my area. I’ve yet to see this wine on a rebat. and I doubt that it will ever be delete. but who knows. My advice is that if you’re looking for a better-than-a-weekday wine or something nice to go with your Friday night dinne. put a bottle of this in your cart next time you’re at the club.

2016 Moniker La Ribera Single Vineyard Chardonnay,This is a lovely wine that caught me off guard with its pleasantness because I really didn’t know what to expect. The single vineyard designation caught my eye but I had never heard of the producer befor. and generally don’t go to Mendocino when I’m looking for Chardonnay value. But that’s exactly what I found. This bottle was $12.99 at Costc. which is great considering retail is $2. and it’s online closer to $18 most places. It also pulled down a 90 point rating from Wine Enthusias. which I agree with wholeheartedly. On the pou. this wine is super ligh. see through almost like a Pinot Grigio. It’s deceptive to the eye because once you get going there’s a bi. full flavored and delightful Chardonnay in here.

2015 Firesteed Pinot Noir Willamette Valley,This is flat out an insane Costco wine buy for only $10.49. Good Pinot is hard to come by at this price poin. but this Firesteed bottle from Oregon’s Willamette Valley is really a standout. It’s funny because the wine steward at my Costco (who doesn’t know I do this site) was hounding me as I was selecting my wine. basically following me around and commenting on the wines I was choosing. I appreciate the effor. and he sincerely wanted me to find good wines. He never asked me why I was taking pictures of everythin. but I digress…Ironicall. this was the first bottle that he recommended and I already had one in my cart. When he saw i. he immediately sai. “buy more. Trust m. it’s excellent.. I should have listened to him. I hope this wine sticks around for a bi. and I really hope you can find it in the stores near you. It’s frankly worth going elsewhere to look for it if your Costco isn’t carrying i. or runs out. If you like Pino. this is a good place to invest. It’s light on the pou. and medium in body; aromatic nose that is floral with berries. In the mouth is a nice flavor profile highlighted by red frui. cherr. cranberr. red licoric. a little Dr Pepper and subtle pepper spice towards the close. It’s not an overbearing or complicated wine. Rathe. it’s simpl. direct and super easy to just enjoy sip after sip. We paired with a ground bison and cauliflower rice dish (all Costco to. love that ground bison) and it was delicious. This is one of those wines you can really pair with anything.

2016 Newton Skyside Chardonnay,This Newton Chardonnay is a perfect example of the balance and elegance that can be found in Sonoma Chardonnays at a good price when they’re done right. There’s not too much oa. or butter. Rathe. this wine tasted more Burgundian in styl. more Chablis-like where the fruit really has a chance to shine through. We enjoyed this wine much more than expected. Costco’s price was $18.99 which is pretty competitive compared to what I could find online where it was as high as $2. and consistently in the low $20’s. Part of the strength of this wine clearly lies in the vineyards from which the grapes are sourced. In this cas. it’s a blend of some of Sonoma’s top areas includingKnights Valle. Alexander Valle. Russian River Valley and Dry Creek Valley. On the nose this wine has a vanilla creamines. followed by stone fruit; in the mouth are flavors of appl. pear and orange; it’s very clea. fruit driven with a hint of oak towards the finish. The wine is medium in body and citrusy throughout. I think this bottle is an excellent buy and we enjoyed with a small group that included one person who wasn’t a huge Chardonnay fa. but they enjoyed this one. We also paired it with some smoked chicken from the Big Green Egg that was dynamit. so that helps of course too.

2014 Marietta Christo Syrah Grenache Petite Sirah Blend,It was quite the surprise running into this bottl. part of a small display tucked into the “cheap seats” (wines stacked in the aisle. not the wooden boxes). I first tried this wine just a a few months ago when it popped up at Cost Plus World Market for a heavy discount (can’t remember what I paid but less than $20 for sure). I really enjoyed it.. Costco’s price of $15.69 is fantastic especially when compared online. And the wine itself is just deliciou. as good the second time around as it was the first. A little big and hefty perhaps for some drinkers during the hot month. but if you like big bold red. regardless of your surrounding temperatur. than this wine is for you. It pours about as dark inky purple as it gets; aromatic nose of spice and blueberr. a little earth. In the mout. loads of pepper and spic. dark chocolate all aroun. red and dark frui. moch. a touch of vanilla. The finish is gigantic and lasting. The blend is rather unique and towards the Rhone side of things:60% Syra. 22% Petite Sira. 14% Grenache and 4% Viognier.. Best served a little below room temp and after a little airtime. This wine is a great change of pac. maybe a little big for this time of the yea. but we had it outside on a fairly warm night with a chocolate dessert that matched pretty good. I’d love to try it again with some smoked ribs or grilled red meat. Wine Advocate and Wine Enthusiast both went 91 points on this win. which is super impressive.

2016 Kendall Jackson Grand Reserve Chardonnay,I really like this wine. Year in and year ou. it just always seems to hit me right. Granted part of that feeling is likely because it’s summertim. it’s ho. and there’s nothing like a cris. refreshin. easy drinking white to sip on by the pool. And that’s how we drank this bottle. The wine is produced from grapes grown in vineyards in Monterey County and Santa Barbara Count. as indicated on the label. And I don’t know what it is about the balance to this win. but it is highly drinkable and very enjoyable for only $13.49 (price a few years ago was $12.9. and it’s $20+ online). We last reviewed the 2012 vintage(and went a whopping 92 points. so it’s been a little while since we posted about this win. but I seem to have a few each year whether it’s out at a restaurant or someone else’s house. For the mone. I think it’s hard to beat this bottle. I enjoyed it quite a bit more than the similarly priced Kirkland Russian River Chardonnay that is in stores now and priced about the same. Maybe it’s just stylistically more in my wheelhous. but if you tend to agree with my tasting note. this Kendall Jackson bottle is worth your time. The wine is super vibrant and youthfu. almost has a creamsicle thing going on that just pairs so well with summer. Not a lot of oak or butter interfering with the flavo. so to that extent the wine even reminded me of an inexpensive Chabli. which isn’t a bad thing at all. Super refreshing with lemo. lim. green appl. and citrus flavor. It’s light and simpl. not a ton of depth or craziness to the finish.

2014 Two Hands Bellas Garden Shiraz Barossa Valley,Once in a while I like to swim a little further upstream and explore some higher priced wines like this one that clocked in at$45.99 at my Costco. I wanted something outside of Cabernet from Napa or Bordeau. and was hoping to find a different varietal from somewhere else in the world of wine. So a Barossa Valley Shiraz was a natural pick. I’ve tasted this wine once befor. several vintages ago and I can’t remember exactly which on. but I remember being impressed. I also remember this wine being a lot more than $4. and a quick Google search will confirm that this is indeed a killer price. This bottle goes for$70 on Wine.com. One other thing you’ll notice when Googling this wine is that it typically scores huge point ratings from the critic. pretty consistently in the93-94 point range. I take these with a grain of sal. but given the consistency year to yea. and reviewer to reviewe. I’d say it’s a good sig. especially combined with my positive past experiences with the wine. S. let’s dig in. The wine is not super dark on the pour; you can see through around the edges; started a little tight out of the bottl. but some decant time brought it to life. It’s drinking nice now but would benefit from a few more years in the bottle. The wine has a beautiful nos. distinctive and pleasant; spicy with forest scents. Excellent mouth fee. with more spice and peppercorn; flavors of dark cherr. blackberr. and anise; leather notes towards the finish which is dry and absolutely insane how long it lasts. This is high quality juice that is well made and packs tons of power. It’s a big win. and we really enjoyed it. I hope to squirrel a couple away in the cellar and perhaps can make a follow up review for our Cellar Series. I’m going 93 points very confidently on this wine. I think in 3-5 years it will even creep up from there. Nice stuf. and worth the money. Don’t forget to hit the Costco Wine forums to discuss this win. and many others.

2016 Clos du Gaimont Vouvray,I love Chenin Blanc from the Loire Valley and that’s exactly what you get with a bottle of Vouvray. It’s not a bottle you see everyda. especially at Costc. but I was looking forward to digging in to see what was inside. This bottle in particular turned out to be a great representation of the are. and the value you can score. It was $15.99 at my Costc. and worth every penny. I loved it. If I had a fridge full of these it would be hard to move far beyond them. These Vouvray wines are dr. refreshing and perfect for summe. while have the complexity to remain interesting on every drink. I’d recommend removing the bottle from the fridge about 15 minutes before you plan on consuming to let it warm up just a bit. If too col. it’s going to mute some of the wonderful flavor we have going on here. The wine pours a ligh. pee yello. honeysuckle and lime on the nose; flavor packed with green appl. pineappl. pear and lemon; big bite of acidity with a finish that sticks around forever. Ideal for summer salad. seafoo. and cheese pairing. you can also equally enjoy on its own as we did. I plan to grab a few more of these if they’re still around for summer drinking.

2016 Matua Sauvignon Blanc Marlborough,This wine caught my eye because of the great price and 90 Point Wine Spectator rating. It appeared in select Costco clubs a couple of weeks ago featured at a price that is easily a few dollars less than most other retailers currently offer. This is a great time of year for Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. The weather outside is hot and sunn. calling for a light and crisp win. while the bountiful fruits of summer are just beginning to make their appearances in grocery stores and home gardens alike. A wine like this will pair well with seasonal fresh produce like ripe berrie. peache. avocad. and fresh tomatoes. Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc pairs well with a variety of seafood as well. I haven’t seen this wine anywhere for less than $10 per bottl. so it’s likely that this is one of those “get it before it’s gone” Costco wine deals. The wine opens with a nose of white peac. grapefrui. jalapeno peppe. and fresh herbs. On the palat. the juice is tart and full-flavored with a nice balance of sweet fruit to grassy herbaceousness. The finish is lingering and refreshing. I feel that Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc tends to fall on a spectrum ranging from ripe grapefruit and passionfruit flavors on one end to lean and green fresh herbs and cut grass on the other. A wine that is too far on one end of the spectrum can be overpowering or off-puttin. but this one falls nicely in the middle. I really love the intensity of flavor in this wine. It’s hard to find that in a wine at this price point. If you like New Zealand Sauvignon Blan. definitely give this one a try. I think it’s an easy contender against the likes of Kim Crawfor. Oyster Ba. and Villa Maria. I would put it a step above Brancot. Nobil. and the Kirkland Signature Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. This is just my personal assessment. Let me know in the comments or in our forum if you agree. Wine Spectator gives this a host of awards including “Best Valu.” 90 Point. and #40 on the Top 100 Wines of 2017 list. Over a half million cases of this wine were produce. and select bottles are stamped with an icon that “turns blue when I’m chilled and ready.” Perhaps an unnecessary marketing gimmic. but intriguing nonetheless. I give this wine one extra point for value. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 Points (a CostcoWineBlog Recommended Wine. Alcohol: 13% AB. Costco Item Number: 76634. Purchased in Bufor.

2015 Hugel Classic Riesling Alsace,I’m always excited to see Riesling from German or France pop up at Costco. It just doesn’t happen enough and it’s usually a nice treat and welcome change of pace from the plethora of Chardonnay that seems to grace the majority of Costco white wine shelves. This wine was a little on the pricey side at$18.9. which isn’t necessarily bad for a wine from Alsac. but a Google search on this one showed it available for a bit lower online. Not a big deal though since as far as under $20 bottles g. this turned out to be a super solid choice for white wine fans. So the big question right off the ba. is whether or not this wine is sweet. I wrote an article for the HuffPost that addressed this question and offered a super simple method for gauging the sweetness of a win. essentially looking at the alcohol content. Anything above 11% is on the dry sid. and below 11% the wines tend to be sweeter. This Hugel bottle came in at 12.5% which told me it would be a dry Rieslin. and it was indeed. Actuall. in rereading that article I noticed a quote I included that“everybody may not like all Riesling. but there’s a Riesling for everybody.”This bottle from Hugel really exemplifies the statement as it is super fruit forwar. juic. fresh and accessible. I think many people who typically don’t like Riesling will enjoy this one. Most of the flavor is citru. and green apple with crisp acidity and a nice mouthfeel; there’s a little minerality and wet stone on the finis. but this is a great summer sipper and would be awesome with light summer cuisin. from salads to white fish like halibut. But we actually sampled it around a pool on its own on a beautiful sunny day and it was fantastic. A nice addition to our Recommended Wine Lis. and a welcome addition to Costco wine shelves.

2016 Long Meadow Ranch Rutherford Sauvignon Blanc,So it’s a hot Atlanta day and I’m by a pool with friends who are mostly drinking Creature Comforts and other GA- based craft beer. but toda. like many day. I’m sipping on white win. and a good one at that. It is the Long Meadow Ranch Sauvignon Blanc from Rutherford. At $15.99 at my Costc. I can drink this one all night long in the summertim. and if there was a beer or wine made for poolside sipping this would be a top contender. The wine is light and zesty; just fun to drink; it’s tarty and fruity with grapefrui. citrus and green apple; finishes with more sour tart. On first pas. if you aren’t paying attentio. you might almost mistake this from a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. It’s made in that styl. but after you get into it a bi. you can tell it’s a little bit different. There’s some solid winemaking going on her. and the grapes are from Napa’s premier Rutherford regio. which was what really stoked my interest. I’d also had this wine (different vintages) several times in the past at restaurants and have always been impressed. This is a real winner as far as Sauvignon Blancs g. which many regular readers will kno. is a varietal that has left me desiring a lot more lately. This bottle fits the bill all around. If this is your style of win. keep an eye out for the Mondavi Oakville Fume Blanc. I just found three left in my store and promptly scooped them all up as that remains one of the best bargains in Costco right now. But this bottle is right in that same ballpark.

Ye. it i. and the remarkably low price of $6.99 is carried over once again. For $6.99 there are few bottles of wine that are as drinkable as this one. Going in this yea. I had high hopes. The prior vintages have impressed u. and this one did too. Earthy on the nos. signature Rioja smell; like we’ve noted befor. you will definitely want to give this wine a little air before jumping in. Even just 20-30 minute. and it begins to open up more. Mostly red fruit flavo. with some tobacco and spice; a really long finish for an inexpensive wine.. Absolutely ridiculous at this price. Spanish wine fans will love this bottl. and for anyone else who likes medium to full bodied reds that are packed with flavo. this is one to try. Rioja is made from the Tempranillo grap. which in just about any of its primary forms (Tor. Riber. Rioja) delivers good quality to price.

2016 Torbreck Woodcutters Shiraz,As I’ve said befor. I am not the biggest fan of Australian Shira. but that’s starting to change when I find bottles like Torbreck Shiraz from Australia’s Barossa Valley priced under $20. This is a unique wine that I couldn’t stop smelling and sipping trying to put it all togethe. which I’m still not sure I did. That’s the sign of a good wine. It’s really all about the mid-palate here that elevates this wine above many other Barossa Shiraz I’ve tried. An aromatic nos. dark on the pou. dark fruit flavor with a little smoked meat that is light but still punchy; the mid palate almost gives off seaside notes like you’re drinking the wine in the middle of a sandbar in the ocean. There’s some wet stone in there too taking you to a finish that isn’t the overly peppery and spicy kind you can get with many Shiraz. Rathe. the wine finishes restrained but strong. There’s nice acidity and balance overall. This wine is a steal for $17.99 (It’s $25 at Wine.com and $30 at Total Wine). Every vintage of this wine from the past five years has scored in the low 90s among most critic. and with this 2016 (excellent vintage. James Suckling even went a whopping 95 points.

2017 Kirkland Signature Cotes de Provence Rose,O. I know it’s Monday and the next review should technically not come out until Wednesda. but we had to get this one in your hands right away based on how fast this wine sold out last year. We could only be talking about theKirkland Cotes de Provence Rose that is hitting stores right now by the pallet. The rock bottom price of $9.49 for this current vintage is a mild $0.50 increase from last yea. and the big question become. is the 2017 as good as the 2016 vintage that we all loved so much. The short answer is yes. You’ll want to stock up on this one on your next visit. And when we say stock u. you should buy for the whole summe. because if last year was any indicatio. this wine will likely sell out in the next 30-45 day. if not sooner. And this wine will be so so good on a super hot summer day. So what’s inside. It’s another interesting blend of grape. starting with the expected varietals of Grenache (25%. Mourvedre (25%. Cinsault (20%) and Syrah (15%. then smaller parts ofTibouren (5%. Rolle (5%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (5%). Again this yea. the label indicates the wineis bottled at Domaine De LaCroi. which we don’t know a ton abou. except they are the same folks who produced last years wine. I found a few other very similar rose wines fromDomaine De LaCroix online and they are priced more than twice as much as this one. This is a crisp and refreshing rose just like you expect from Provence. It’s pale salmon in colo. dry throughout with a nice touch of acidit. red berry fruit and citru. medium in body with a minerally finish.

2014 Robert Mondavi Oakville Fume Blanc,Every now and then Costco will get a wine for a mega-good bargain price. This one jumped out at me yesterday. I noticed first that the price was significantly less than normal retail and second that the wine has been immediately deleted (marked with an asterisk). Robert Mondavi originally coined the marketing term “Fume Blanc” in the late 1960s when he started growing Sauvignon Blanc in Napa Valley. He needed a way to distinguish his dry-style offering from the low-quality and sweet juice that was currently available in the market. He chose to use the word “Fume” after the famed Pouilly Fume region in the Loire Valley of Franc. known for its dry and fuller-bodied Sauvignon Blanc wine. since this was closer to the style of wine he was producing. He could have trademarked the name under his brand but instead chose to allow all winemakers to use it. Hence toda. you will often see wines from various producers that are labeled “Fume Blanc.. Despite common misconceptio. this wine is not sweet nor is it made from a grape called Fume. I like to think that Fume Blanc is to Sauvignon Blanc what Pinot Gris is to Pinot Grigio. Both wines are made from the same grap. but the former styles are fuller and rounder-bodied while the latter tend to be lean and more citrus-driven. I personally love Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc. While not as widely-grown or popular as the other Bordeaux varietal. I think the quality and concentration of flavor for Sauvignon Blanc-based wines is really just heads above those from other New World areas. A good-quality California Sauvignon Blanc will just explode with tropical fruit flavors of peac. grapefrui. and pineapple while maintaining notable floral components balanced by subtle minerality. What can be more delicious than that. This is a heavier style of Sauvignon Blanc than what most of you are probably accustomed to. Tasting this alongside a Marlborough offering would likely make you doubt that the two wines are made from the same grape. This wine needs a few minutes to ope. and I wouldn’t serve it ice cold. The nose gives away oak-aging with pronounced vanilla &amp; caramel aromas. I also picked up on ripe pineapple and floral notes. Surprising acidity and dryness on the palate confuse my brain since the wine tastes nothing like it smell. and the finish is lingering with a little bit a heat on account of a relatively high alcohol content. There is an almost savory or saline note as well. I also detected a bit of yeasty creaminess on the finish which tells me that the wine was aged on its lees for a time. If the finish on a white wine reminds you of Champagn. you can bet there is some sur lie action happening. I like to check the tech sheet. usually available on the winery’s websit. after I taste a wine in order to confirm what I believe to be true. Upon doing s. I learned that this wine is a blend of 79% Sauvignon Blanc and 21% Semillio. aged in 60 gallon French Oak barrels (8% new. and then aged sur lie for eight months with hand stirring (batonnage). This is essentially crafted as a traditional White Bordeaux would be. One thing that I found to be particularly interesting is that 100% of the fruit for this wine comes from Mondavi’s famed To Kalon (Greek for “Highest Beauty”) Vineyard. S. not only is this wine Oakville-specifi. but it is also a single vineyard wine. Sauvignon Blanc ages well when Semillon is added to the blend. I never shy away from purchasing an older vintage of a Sauvignon Blanc that has been oak-aged or blended in the traditional Bordeaux style. Because the current vintage offered at Costco is 201. I would recommend buying one for now (or however many you think you may drink this summer) and perhaps one to hold and see where it goes. This is definitely a food win. and I paired mine with a sliced and slightly-overripe Gala apple (also purchased at Costco) which I feel went nicely at the time (as far as breakfast goes). This wine would pair really well with white fish dishes and raw oysters. I think some home-run pairings would be grilled Halibut with a tropical fruit salsa or Cod Piccata. Wine Spectator gives this wine 91 Points and describes it as “offering a mix of honeysuckl. candied ginger pee. and lemon verbena flavors on a smooth and crisp bod.” which are not flavors that I initially picked up on but that I agree are there. I wish I had pinpointed Lemon Verbena because that call is spot on. The publication lists the price at $4. which is what the winery currently offers this wine for. Costco offers it for $12.99. My personal belief as to why this wine is priced so well is that the current market does not demand this style of Sauvignon Blanc in nearly the same quantities as California Chardonnay or New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. At least in the area that I live i. New World whites that are presented in Old-World styles are a bit confusing to the consume. and I suspect that a significant number of members may see this wine and wonder what it is exactly. For you who are informe. take advantage of this opportunity because the wine is deleted and likely not to return at this price if at all.

2013 Bodegas La Horra Corimbo Ribera del Duero,Here’s another Spanish wine gem that I scored at my Costco for $21.99. I say ‘another’ because there seems to be a stream of awesome bottles from Riber. Toro and Rioja in that sweet spot of $15-$25 that I have found to generally be super strong buys. Our latest reviews of this Toro wine and this Gran Reserva Riojafrom Costco are great example. and we rated them all in the 90. as we will do with this bottle we are reviewing today. For straight up price to qualit. Spain is hard to beat right no. and certainly worth exploring if you’re still on the peripheral. This wine has a spic. earthy nose with a little campfire; it is super dark on the pour and full in body. Bi. juicy flavor in the mout. led by spicy cherry and red frui. a little wild strawberry; herbal and clove notes towards the finish which is supe. super dry. This wine is built for pairing up with red mea. which is how we enjoyed i. and although it’s elegant enough to ride on its ow. the pairing brings so much more out of the food and the wine. If you’re a fan of well crafte. big red. don’t pass this one up if you see it at your local Costco.

2015 Kirkland Signature Series Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon,Looks like we missed the 2014 vintage of this one which really bums me out because these Kirkland Oakville wines are always tremendous value. this current one included. We went 90 points on the 2013 vintage and highlighted many of the same characteristics that I’m finding now in the 2015 vintage. The price has stayed consistent at $18.99 which is totally fair for a wine of this caliber and certainly beats almost any other Oakville bottle you’ll find on the market. That’s what we love about Kirkland wines; access to great areas for less. In the case of Oakvill. it’s one of my favorites in Napa. Interestingly enoug. I had a glass of the 2015 Est 75 Tuck Beststoffer Napa red left over from the previous night so was able to enjoy both these wines side by side. Both right there at the 90 point level for m. but very different in style. The Est 75 was priced on sale for $1. but is normally $20 so they are right there in the same price range too. I found the Kirkland Oakville to be darker in frui. more black berr. a touch more elegant in style and balanced. They are both excellent wines for the mone. but I’m going to give the edge to the Kirkland bottle. It pours a little lighter than its flavor leads o. expressive nos. that black fruit noted above and then finishes just super stron. like you would expect from a Napa Cab priced much higher. The finish and the balance are what were really notable for me her. especially for under $20. I’m going to bump this year up to 91 points. This is one of my favorite Kirkland buy. and while I’m a huge fan overall of the ’13 vintage in Nap. this bottle from ’15 is impressing me a tad more than the ’13. Nic. nice juice for the mone. and exactly what we expect from a Kirkland offering. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 point. Costco item number:86666. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. GA (Cumberland.

2015 Joseph Drouhin Saint Veran,France’s famed Burgundy region is a challenging wine region to navigate. It’s best properly explored with a lot of tasting and a map to mark the geographic coordinates of all the wines. But to assist my exploration of the area I keep a mental list of certain cue. be it micro regions or producer. so when I’m picking a wine I can find something relatable and have a decent idea of what I’m going to get. The cue for me here is the name Joseph Drouhi. a highly regarded estate that owns vineyards and produces wine from all the main areas of Burgundy including Chabli. Cote de Nuit. Beaune (where this wine is from) and Chalonnaise. They even own a vineyard in Oregon’s Willamette Valley. To find one of these wines for $16 at Costco was a score (it’s $22 at Total Wine). I grabbed a few for later too as I think these might go fast. Saint Veran is in theMaconnais subregio. which you seem to be hearing more about but the wines aren’t quite as easy to find as those from neighboringPouilly-Fuisse. That’s another reason why it was nice to see this one pop up. Chardonnay is the varietal in both regions. Definitely pours on the darker yellow sid. fresh aromas and really nice fruit; mostly green apple and citrus flavor although as I got into the wine more I noticed some orange peel and vanilla cream; balanced acidity with lingering flavor throughout the finish; subtle on the oa. very Burgundian in style. Clean and refreshing. I love that we can buy this for $16 as it is a high caliber wine from a region you just don’t find too many other wines available even and certainly not priced that low.

2015 Paul Dolan Zinfandel,We reviewed the 2015 Paul Dolan Cabernet last Apri. and earlier this year the winery’s Zinfandel from the same line appeared in my local Georgia warehouse. I used my Coravin Wine Preserver to open and taste this wine. If you don’t have on. I would recommend making this small investment. I’ve written a detailed description about the device befor. but I will briefly explain why the Coravin is so useful. For the most par. you can “open” a bottle of wine in order to taste it or to pour just one glas. then put it back on your wine rack for another day. I recently opened a bottle of high-quality ’96 Cabernet that I Coravined nearly a year ago and it tasted the same now as it did the. even though a glass has been missing from the bottle while it rested in my wine chiller. Paul Dolan’s 2015 Zinfandel from Mendocino County has a whopping 15% alcohol conten. which I think is pretty high even for red zinfandel. The bottle is heavy and has a deep pun. which is what I usually expect from a wine that costs over $30 a bottle (this wine is currently $12.79 at Costco). I love the label because it’s very clea. simple and classy-looking. You can order the current vintage of this juice directly from the winery’s website for $25 per bottl. or elsewhere online for an average of around $16. The wine opens with a nose of jammy red and black fruit. vanill. and orange marmalade. The palate is fruit-forward with dark berrie. chocolat. and baking spice that finishes with a little bit of heat. The wine is lighter in body than I expected from the alcohol content. It’s a more elegant style of Zinfandel. I would definitely serve this cooler than room temperature (60-65 degrees). Wine Enthusiast gives this wine 89 Points and an “Editor’s Choice” designation as well as naming it one of the “bi. bold reds for your summer BBQ.. One notable thing about California Zinfandel is that it pairs well with a variety of foods. Any sort of grilled or stewed meat with a tomato-based sauc. especially one that’s a little bit swee. will go well this style of wine. I would avoid overly spicy foods with this because the heat of the higher alcohol level will overly accentuate the spice. For those of you who drink reds throughout the summe. this is a good choice to offer your guests on the outdoor patio. Just remember not to serve it too warm. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 Point.

Kirkland Champagne Brut,Whenever someone asks me what the best buy in Costco wine is I typically recommend for that person to try all the Kirkland branded wines as they offer a fair value for the varietal and region represented. From ther. decide what you like best. If pressed for a specific Kirkland wine to bu. this Kirkland Champagne is my go t. year round and for all occasion. not just celebrations. This is an absolute steal for only $20 as it represents real French Champagne and every single time I open a bottle I’m impressed more and more. Granted my tastes and preferences change over tim. but this is likely the Costco wine that I purchase the most. It’s delicat. yet refreshing and dry but complex and like most Champagne. it just puts people in a good mood. The wine is a blend ofPinot Noi.

2012 Bodega Carmen Rodriguez Carodorum Seleccion Especial Reserva Toro,Almost instinctivel. I will purchase new wines that I find from Spain’s Toro region because they are some of the best buys in the wine world today. So obviousl. I love when they pop up at Costco. This bottle was of particular interes. initially due to its massive weight in the hand but also for the 96 point sticker from Wine Enthusiast proudly displayed on the front of the bottle. For a$28.99 wine (Costco price) to receive 96 point. I was both impressed and skeptical. I cheated and gave the wine a quick Google before purchasin. only to find that 96 point rating along with the wine’s retail price of $110. So is Costco really offering it at less than a third of retail? That appeared to be the case. But what’s inside? Is this a good win. even at the Costco price of $29? It turns out the answer is a resounding yes. This is a beautiful wine that is giant in body and flavor but also generously elegant with a modern feel. I’ve had a few similar Toro wines in the pas. where it comes across as a combination of old vine grapes in a more new world style. And I’m a fan. The wine pours near black in the glas. and ye. it’s a hefty drink with alcohol at 15. but it really worked for us. Super vibrant aromas after the wine had a chance to breathe; smells like a flower shop with a heap of fresh soil dumped in the middle of the store; big and bold in the mouth with loads of black cherr. blackberr. anis. a touch of dark chocolate; super super dry into the finish. Maybe one of the driest wines I’ve had in quite a while. We didn’t pair this wine with a meal which is really too bad. A huge juicy steak would send an already amazing wine over the top because of the chalky finish. There’s a lot to this win. keeping you guessing and interested on every drin. which I want good wines to always do. I can’t recommend this one enoug. and at $29 it’s not an inexpensive win. but for what you ge. it really is a steal. This is an obvious addition to the Recommended Wine list. I can’t go as high in my rating as Wine Enthusias. but this is a solid low 90’s win. so I’m going to go 93 points. I’d like to taste it again in another 2-3 years to allow it to develop a little further and I think it would be magnificent. Enjoy this Costco buy if you find it. I bet these go fast.

2009 Bodegas Montecillo Rioja Gran Reserva,What makes a good wine an even more unbelievable buy? When Costco works their magi. and knocks a whopping $7 off a bottle that was already fairly priced. This is that wine. Here it is at Wine.com on sale for $2. marked down from $35. I picked it up at Costco for only $15.99 with the $7 off the original price of $22.9. which lasts through 4/8/18 (at least at my Costc. and I hope yours too). After the first tast. I knew I would have paid full pop for this wine. Regular readers know I love these Gran Reservas and anything under $25 is worth exploring. Note: the wines on both sides of this Rioja are also excellent buy. particularly the Perrin Cotes du Rhone for only $8 on sale. That is a steal on the base wine from a famed Rhone winemaker (same one that makes Beaucastel Chateauneuf-du-Pap. my favorite. The key to these Gran Reserva Riojas is the aging. It’s already taken care of for you Sur. this one could go a bit longe. but what you’re getting is a wine that already has two years of oak agin. and another three in the bottl. likely in mostly stellar conditions at the winer. delivered right to your Costco. A sweet deal in my opinion. Right out of the bottle on the first tast. I could tell we had a winne. but after chilling out with some air it really started to get in line. It pours semi dark although you can see through in some areas; the nose is a jo. super flora. peppery and herbal. But in the mouth is where this one really shines.

2012 Foncalieu Les Illustres Coteaux d’Enserune,I was really excited to try this wine. First of. I’d never heard of it and as you can see belo. the Costco bin was full minus the one bottle I bought. After I brought it hom. I started Googling about i. but didn’t find much. So the intrigue was building right up until the moment I opened it. The story on the bottle does a pretty good job setting the stage for what’s inside. Eight winegrowers joined forces with the goal of creating an excellent wine fromthe Coteaux d’Ensérune which is located in France’s Languedoc region (I have never heard of Coteaux d’Ensérune but a little research indicated the area has 2 cooperative winerie. and 19 independent wineries; so pretty small area). The blend they put forth here is60% Syra. 30% Cabernet Sauvigno. and 10% Malbec. And I thought it was outstandin. and a good buy for $25.99 at Costco. The nose is a little stinky at firs. then lets off more earth and floral scents. The nose becomes quite lovely actually as the wine gets some air. It’s medium to full in bod. very spicy throughou. which I enjo. reminiscent of a top notch Rhone wine (Gigondas comes to mind). More spice into the finish which is bone dr. sticky and lasting. This is really a nicely balanced wine that will please all types of red wine fans. Be sure to get it out in the decanter for a bit before enjoying. Parker went 92 points on this win. and I’m going to agree with him. We will also be adding to our Recommended Wine list.

2014 Chateau de Beaucastel Chateauneuf-du-Pape,I’m a huge fan of Chateauneuf-du-pape wines and year to year the Beaucastel is one of my favorite splurges. It tastes great no. plus has potential to age incredibly well. Just last year I was visiting one of my favorite restaurants that not surprisingly also has a ridiculous (and reasonably priced) wine selection. After browsing through the thousand page book we settled on a 1998 Beaucastel Chateauneuf. I was so curious how it would taste 20 years later and it did not disappoint. We gave it a little air in the decanter and sipped on it over the course of a long mea. enjoying layer upon layer as it opened i. full of life. Because of the aging potential of these wine. I’ve put a few bottles of the more recent vintages in the cella. including a bottle of this ’1. to appreciate later down the line. Now grante. I know this wine isn’t cheap at $69.9. but compared to the price you’ll find at many other outlet. including the wine warehouse across the street from my Costc. this bottle will go for closer to $100. I have seen a few places online offering it closer to Costco’s price though. But you are getting a high caliber wine for the money. The wine is medium plus in bod. with earthy aroma. a little smoke and dark fruit on the nose; more licoric. and red frui. spicy cherry in the mout. with herbs and pepper entering the mix towards the finish.

2015 Kirkland Signature Sonoma County Old Vine Zinfandel,This wine has been a consistent good value in the past few vintages. It always seems to be popular among members as wel. many of whom will confidently tell you it tastes like a bottle that costs twice the price. For this reaso. I have a few each of the 2013 and 2014 releases in my collection for those nights that I’m in the mood for a jamm. fruit-forward wine. You’d be hard-pressed to find a California Zinfandel that’s under 14% alcohol by volume these days. The warm areas in which Zinfandel likes to grow lend berries that are full of suga. and in order to achieve an appropriate level of phenolic ripenes. winemakers must leave the grapes on the vine long enough to allow this to happen. This results in wine that has higher alcohol and residual sugar levels. California Zinfandel is popular in the United States for the same reason that Meiom. Menage-a-Troi. and Apothic wines are: residual sugar. We Americans love our sugar. The 2015 Kirkland Signature offering boasts a staggering 15.5% AB. and while there is definitely some heat on the nose and palat. moderate acidity keeps everything in check. The wine pours somewhere between ruby and garnet red. The nose of ripe red fruits and black plums is moderately intense along with hints of sweet baking spic. particularly cloves. Full and spicy on the palat. ripe fruit persists with blueberries and a very subtle petrol aftertaste (it works here though). The finish is long. I spent my weekend completing the first level of the Court of Master Sommelier. and I learned a few things about wine and food pairing that I feel useful to mention here. While there are a few basic principals to wine pairin. there really is no one-size-fits-all rule. First of al. sugar needs to be matched with sugar. Because this wine has a bit of residual suga. it would pair well with sauces that are also a little bit sweet. I would avoid pairing this higher-alcohol juice with anything too spicy as it will only accentuate the heat in both. I think that a rack of BBQ ribs or pulled pork would pair nicely. Grilled pork pairs well with fruit sauce. and so drinking a fruity wine like Zinfandel is completely appropriate for that occasion. Finall. for the upcoming Valentine’s Day holida. this moderately acidic wine will pair well with a high-quality milk chocolate. Or you could just pair it with a wine glass and call it a day.

2010 Baron de Ley Gran Reserva Rioja,This is an absolute steal at Costco right now; another killer Rioja buy right on the heels of the amazing2012 Hidalgo Tradicion H Rioja we just reviewed. That wine was only $15 and I went 92 point. and this one is slightly more at $21.49 but I might have to move beyond 92 points as it really is that exceptional. 2010 was a great vintage in Europ. and being a Gran Reserva this winespent at least 2 years in oak and 3 years in the bottle before being released. I’ve mentioned before how I love to grab these already aged wines where the winery did everything for you. This wine is drinking nicely now and could go for a bit longer but it’s a real treat to just walk up to the bin at Costco and drop this in your cart for just over $20 without having to think about a thing. Prices online range from $3. to $3. so Costco again comes in way below the going price. So what’s in the bottle? I get big time cigar box on the nose and throughou. cedar toward the beginning and more oak towards the finish. In the middle this wine is medium in bod. with tannins settling in gentl. leading to a sof. elegant mouthfeel. Flavors are predominantly dark frui. blackberry with black cherr. anis. and a little vegetal component towards the very dry finish. So well done for the money it’s hard to compare to other $20 bottles from anywhere else in the world. I’m afraid to review more bottles moving forward after this as I feel like I’m going to be disappointed. Lots to love here everyone.

2015 Kirkland Signature Pauillac Bordeaux,I know several of you saw this one hit stores a few weeks ag. and it finally made it to me. I was excite. not only because I needed to get a review out to everyon. but also because I love good Bordeaux and find these wines to be tremendous values. The 2014 vintage was a lovely win. one that we went 91 points o. and felt that it could benefit from a few years in the bottle. So I have a couple in the cellar I plan to crack later. 201. from a vintage perspectiv. was the return of France. ’1. ’1. and ’16 in France are shaping up to be monstrous vintages following the decent ’12-’13 vintages. Luckily for us ’12 and ’13 were huge in Californi. so I’d stock up on those years from CA now (plus ’14 from CA. and get ready to fill your French wine void as these newer vintages start hitting stores. This was my first taste of a ’15 Bordeau. and although a little tight at firs. I could tell we had a winner on our hands. This is exceptional juice for only $22.9. and a step up even from last year. Pauillac is a left bank Bordeaux which means that it is a Cabernet Sauvignon based blen. and may include smaller parts of Merlo. Cab Fran. Carmener. Petit Verdot and Malbec. I wasn’t sure what the varietal breakdown was on this bottle but they did a great job. I’d guess a little lighter on the Cab Fran. as I didn’t get as many vegetal/bell pepper notes on this vintage as I did on the ’14. This wine is a combo of red and dark frui. oak accents towards the finish which is super dry. Nice depth throughout and amazing mouthfeel that I expect will only develop further with age. That sai. I’ll probably have to lay down a bottle or two to try back to back down the line with the ’14 that’s in the cellar. Otherwis. I’d say the ’15 is drinking better young than the prior vintag. so have at it now. Give it a little decant to open up. This is strong buy and a perfect example of why you should shop for wine at Costco. Hope you enjoy as much as I did. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 92 Points (a CostcoWineBlog Recommended Wine.

2012 Hidalgo Tradicion H Rioja,As I write this right no. I have no idea how much I paid for this wine. It was part of a mass buy made sometime during the holiday season because as we all know Costco is a great place to stock up on win. especially in large quantities. The story here is that I pulled the cor. poured a small glass to see where it was and poured the rest in a decanter. I talked to my Amazon Echo and said “play music by Ella Fitzgerald” then sniffed the wine which was a little stinky. But then with that first taste I actually said “wow” out lou. and it wasn’t just because of the music. This is a fantastic win. and towards the end of this review when I upload the image and look at my note. I’ll realize how much I paid. But it almost doesn’t matter. This is Rioja done righ. drinking in a perfect window right now. So that Bordeaux-esque “dirty diaper” or barnyard smell didn’t diminish right away on the nos. but once in the mouth it’s completely a different wine. Go with a decant for sure even if you usually don’t decant when we recommend it. It needs it to balance out. But once there you are presented with a lovely wine that feels great in the mouth and is expressive as could be. Massive flavor and depth of profile. Just luscious to a point where it’s hard to stop drinking. Dark frui. blackberr. anis. dr. sticky in the finish. So much to like here. I’m buying at least two more to cellar as this is a score and a half. I just looked at my receipt and I paid $14.99. I might buy more than two. A quick google search gives you a Wine Enthusiast score of 93 points and a retail price of $30. It’s hard to believe at Costco’s price and that rating that these are still hanging around. Regardles. this is a clear Costco must buy wine. I hope that you are able to find this one at warehouses near you. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 92 points (a CostcoWineBlog Recommended Wine.

2013 E Guigal Cotes du Rhone Rouge,Year in and year ou. the Cotes du Rhone from E Guigal has been a winner. Our last review was the 2011 vintage which we thoroughly enjoye. and this one might be a step up from there. Let’s set aside the unbelievable Costco price on this wine for a minute ($12.89) and dive into the win. which drinks like it’s priced two or three times what it is. Give this one out blind to Rhone fans and see what they guess it to be. I’d peg it as a higher end Gigonda. or even Chateauneuf. The wine is comprised of 50% Syra. 45% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre so it’s the classic Rhone varietals. Fresh on the nos. floral and spicy with hints of cinnamon; big and bold in the mout. full bodied with a blast of dark fruit; more spice and pepper notes towards the finish which is bone dry. There’s really nothing not to like here. Fans of Rhone wines will be impressed. Other red wine fans should take note of the Rhone valley as a hot bed for value buy. this bottle being the golden child of recent Rhone bottles we’ve tried. And like all Rhone wine. you can pair this with almost any cuisine. Thanks Costco. This is one I plan to stock up on at this ridiculous price. Parker went 91 points which is pretty big but it speaks to the caliber of the wine we’re talking about. I’m going to come in a little below the. but the first number is definitely still a 9 for me.

2014 Catena Malbec Mendoza,The Catena name is synonymous with great wine. and they are especially well known for their value driven Malbecs like we have here. At $16.8. Costco again delights with a competitive price ($20 elsewhere onlin. but we saw it for $17 at Total Wine). With the holidays approachin. this is an excellent go-to bottle for almost any occasion whether you need to bring a wine to a dinner party or entertain guests at your place. The wine pours dark in the glas. followed by bright red cherry aromas and a little earthiness. In the mout. the fruit is a combination of red and dar. more ripe cherry with blackberry; touches of vanilla and earthiness towards the finish with pepper and some dark chocolate notes. A lengthy and superb finish. This is a wine that knows exactly what it wants to be. If you’ve enjoyed Catena Malbec in the pas. this one will fall right in line with your expectations. Year to year it’s a consistent winne. and always a wine we are happy to see line the shelves of Costco. I picked up four bottles to have on hand. This one also works well as a nice second bottle for those nights when you want to keep the wine flowing. We will be adding it to our Recommended Wines list. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 point.

2015 Patrick Lesec Galets Blonds Chateauneuf-du-Pape,We haven’t seen as many Chateauneufs in warehouses as we would like. But maybe that’s starting to change which is common around this time of the year. I noticed the always incredible Beaucastel is in stoc. which is a favorite (and an expensive treat. but then saw this bottle priced at $26.9. which is pretty amazing for a wine from this region. The nose is old worl. earthy and spic. distinctively Europea. and smells (and tastes) older than a ’15. In the mouth are flavors ofred frui. peppe. spic. black licorice and notes of an old library book. The wine wasa little hot and smoky out of the bottle but that dissipated after some time in the decanter. I thought the finish was superb and drove the fruit home with more spic. herbs and tons of stickiness. There was a slightlingering taste of alcohol on the first few taste. but again something that was less noticeable over time. At $26.99 this is a huge value buy for fans of Southern Rhone wine. and is just $5 more than Costco’s own Kirkland Chateauneu. the past few vintages of which I haven’t enjoyed nearly as much as this wine. I’d say this one is a buy all day long and a great complement to any cuisine you might be preparing this holiday season. It received a 91-94 from Wine Advocat. which is pretty impressiv. and I’m going to go on the lower side of that. I could see my score bumping up a point or two after this one developed in the bottle another few years. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a CostcoWineBlog Recommended Wine.

2013 Flora Springs Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,I thought this was anabsolute ge. granted we enjoyed it in perfect circumstances with some Green Egg-grilled Filets. My only regret is that it might be a little early for this one to really show its true colors. Many of you know what a fan I am of the ’13 Napa vintag. and this wine is a perfect example of why. It’s just so hard not to crack them open toda. knowing that they will flourish in the years to come. So I’ll be trying to find this one again at my Costcos (price was $34.99) so I can lay a couple down in the cellar. The nose was fres. floral with some cedar and black fruit. Flavors of dark cherry frui. anise and dark chocolate/mocha; it is more interesting every drink and over a few hours while the wine opens up; I’d recommend an hour decan. minimum. The finish is dry andlasts forever making this wine the perfect complement for a medium rare Filet. Picked up some notes of clove and spice (nutmeg) on the finish along with further cedar notes. The wine is a blend of 88% Cabernet Sauvigno. 7% Merlo. 3% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. I’m super impressed at this price as this one exceeds many top Napa names that I’ve tasted at twice the price. I’m also a big fan of the Flora Springs Trilogy red blend that has been known to pop up at Costco from time to time so keep an eye out for that one too. I don’t think I’ve had a disappointing wine from this great producer. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 93 points (a CostcoWineBlog Recommended Wine. Costco item number:37442.

2009 Marques de Caceres Rioja Gran Reserva,Long time readers will know that we are huge fans of Gran Reserva Rioja. particularly the La Rioja Alta 90. which has its 2007 vintage landing in Costco stores right now. But when we found this one for $25.9. it landed in the cart immediately with hopes of a wine on the same caliber as the 904 but for $15-$20 less. And it’s everything we hoped it would b. a home run for this price range and a wine that is drinking beautifully right no. eight years later. Quick primer on the Gran Reservas – they are only released for certain stellar vintages so you often times don’t see them in back to back years. To carry the Gran Reserva designatio. the wine must age at least two years in oak and then three in bottle prior to release. There is also the standard “Reserva” designation and below that “Crianza” that require less time both in the barrel and the bottle. So Gran Reserva is the head honch. and typically prices climb past $4. so to find one in the mid- $20’s is a score. I figured that wine was primarily Tempranillo in make up but after some poking around I found the varietal makeup which is85% Tempranill. 8% Garnacha tint. 7% Graciano. This bottle needs a minimum of an hour decan. and I would recommend closer to two hours if you really want to see what you’ve got. In the glas. the wine is fresh and livel. no signs of age around the rim; dried fruit on the nose along with some spice and notes of anise and perfume. In the mout. this wine has great layered textur. mild tannins that have chilled out creating a silky smooth elegant feel; flavors of dark frui. plu. with some smoke/campfire lingering in the mouth in the finish. It’s a dry win. savory on the finish which lasts forever. Each drink is more interesting than the las. which is the mark of a great wine. This is a fun one to sip on with or without food. We did the latter and really tried to take it in. If you’ve never ventured in the realm of Gran Reserva Riojas because of the price ta. here’s an easy ticket in. If you hav. then you will likely want to stock up on a few of these before they disappear. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 points (a CostcoWineBlog Recommended Wine. Costco item number:85257.

2010 Bonacchi Molino del Piano Brunello di Montalcino,Costco did us right by offering this superb 2010 Brunello for the awesome price of only $26.99. They teased us with the ’10 Kirkland Signature Brunello which we thought was outstandin. only to follow it up with two mediocre Brunello offerings for the ’11 and ’12 vintages. The main appeal of the Kirkland Brunello is the pric. $2. which is pretty much unheard of in the land of decent Brunello. until now. The best thing they could do would be to bring in a Brunello offering from the 2010 vintage at the same price point as that 2010 Kirkland one that we loved so much (but that is long gone from warehouses). Wel. here is that bottle. This 2010 Brunello landed right in that sweet spo. and I was really hoping I would find something memorable especially given the 92 point Robert Parker sticker attached to the bottle. Usually not a huge factor for m. but it did give the bottle just a touch more street cred. Out of the bottle the wine is nowhere near ready to consume. This wine requires an hour decan. after which it started to open up and come together into the delicious wine that it is. It pours a ligh. almost see thoug. slightly rusty red in the glass; showing early signs of a little age; nose of red frui. flowers and a touch of cherry cola. A similar profile in the mout. more red frui. nice round cherr. red licoric. cola and then leather and earthy notes towards the finish; medium in body with sharp acidity and a dusty finis. this a food lover’s dream wine. We paired this with some (Costco bought) ground bison meatballs which was outstanding. But this wine is so goo. and versatile it could go with about anything. This is a bottle I’d stock up on if you see it as I think once word gets ou. they will go fast. A fun one for holiday parties too.

2013 BV Tapestry Reserve Red Blend Napa Valley,This is really a beautiful win. a classic Napa red blen. utilizing 5 Bordeaux varietals in an expression that is totally Napa from start to finish. This wine is from the excellent ’13 vintage (my favorite of the ’12-’14 trifecta of great years) and while it is drinking nicely no. it has plenty of room to run and develop further in the years to come. Without a doubt I plan on cellaring at least a couple of these if they are still available on my next trip to Costco. It’s medium to full in bod. with a great structure and balance that speaks to its potential for aging. Flavors were acombination of red and dark frui. with plum and then leathe. anise notes; the wine finishes extra dr.chalky and peppery making this wine irresistible with a nice juicy steak (which is how we enjoyed it). That excellent finish goes on forever and really might be the highlight of a wine with many favorable things to note. The varietal makeup is65% Cabernet Sauvigno. 22% Merlo. 5% Petit Verdo. 5% Malbe. 3% Cabernet Franc. Although it’s not an inexpensive win. I feel it’s a nice buy among similarly priced Napa Cabs and a good example of the quality bump you get when you step up from the $25-$35 range. The retail price is $65 and online you can find this wine for closer to $55. Costco’s price is $49.99. I was really happy with this on. so we’ll be adding it to our Recommended Wine picks.

2014 Luke Cabernet Sauvignon Wahluke Slope Columbia Valley,I had a feeling this was going to be a powerhous. but holy smoke. this wine is like a wild animal that becomes uncaged the minute you pull the cork. I say that in a good way as I think fans of bi. bold wines will find a lot to like here. It’s a well made wine and with 15.2% alc. it’s ideal after a hard day in the office (without being overbearing). The wine pours dark and thick; aromas of spicy red frui. peppe. and dark chocolate; in the mouth is where this wine shines; it’s juicy with mocha/espresso flavor. spicy dark cherr. a touch of Andes mint and a little bit of Vicks cough drops towards the end; the finish is dry and sticky. It’s comprised of an interesting blend of “support” varietal. 5% Petit Verdot and 2% Malbe. to complement the93% Cabernet Sauvignon. Online and at Total Wine this bottle is priced in the low $20’s. Costco is selling at $18.99 which is a fair price indeed especially for those readers who enjoy these gigantic wine. which I tend to enjoy as the cooler months approach. We’re now two for two in the last week on reviews hitting the Recommended Wines list.

2010 Bodegas Balbas Ardal Reserva Selection Especial Ribera del Duero,I’m always skeptical when wineries proudly place stickers on their bottles to promote the high scores the wines have received by the mainstream wine ratings companies. Just the other week we tasted a bottle rated 93 points by one of these outlet. and it fell way below expectations for us. This on. howeve. proudly stamped 94 points by Wine Spectato. is an outlie. a true gem that I am going to stock up on every chance I get. Wine Spectator tastes blin. which lends a great deal more credibility to their ratings. Tha. combined with the fact that I tend to agree with them more often than no. gives them more credence in my book. In the case of this Spanish blend from Ribera del Duer. I’d say they’ve hit the nail on the hea. uncovering an amazing win. and one that we are lucky enough to be able to score at Costco for only $20. When I see Ribera del Duer. I usually guess 100% Tempranillo in the make up but this one actually included 20% Cabernet Sauvigno. which I think is what helped add to the depth and complexity. Being a 201. this wine is ready to drink right now. Sur. you could age it for a few more year. but the degree to which it is going to change is likely marginal. It was a little tight out of the bottle but showed early signs of a high caliber wine. An hour later from the decante. this wine was right where I hoped it would be. A nose that conveys qualit. that is earthy and juicy; this wine is medium plus in body; flavors of spicy dark cherr. wild strawberr. plum with hints of a little leather and campfire towards the finish. Finishes dry and dust. complete. I really love the balance here. Everything is in order and it makes for a wine that would be awesome in almost any occasion. At $2. this one is hard to bea. so it will certainly be an addition to our Recommended Wines list. For everyone out there looking for the highly regarded Kirkland Riber. this wine may cost a little mor. but it’s worth it for what is in my opinion one of the best buys in Costco wine in recent memory.

2014 Chateau Potelle The Illegitimate California Red Blend,There’s a lot going on her. both with the way this wine tastes but also the marketing behind it. I probably spent more time researching this wine and its roots back to Chateau Potelle than any other wine in recent memory. So here it goes. This is a “second flag” or “second bottle” from Chateau Potell. which was started by a French family in the 1980’s in St Helena who initially came to scout out what was happening in California’s wine industry but they were so impressed they stayed. One of the elements they found most attractiv. and in contrast to the traditional French rules of wine-makin. was the ability to produce a wide variety of wines without the restraints dictating which grapes can be grown in which areas. The winery produces Chardonna. Syra. Cab Fran. Zinfande. Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon as well as several special blends I’ve never seen anywhere els. like this on. that is blended from grapes grown on Mt Veeder (Napa) and St Julien Bordeaux. Interesting to say the least. They also produce this bottl. cleverly titled The Illegimat. because as they note on the back of the bottl. you won’t find a blend this wild anywhere else. It’s a perfect example of their philosophy to blend different and less commonly matched varietals. Note the three flags on the front label too: a French fla. a CA state flag and a flag with an upside-down Fleur de Ly. symbolizing a reverse of French tradition.. So what’s in this wine? From my research (and tasting. it sounds like it’s a combination of Cabernet Sauvigno. Merlo. Syra. Barber. Petit Sirah and Zinfandel. I wish I had the percentage breakdown of each of these because they did a rather masterful job putting this wine together. Vibran. floral aroma. this wine is fresh and juicy. In the mouth it expresses dark fruit flavor. blackberr. sour cherry and anise with dark chocolate and spic. peppery notes towards the finish. Finishes super dry. I enjoyed this one more than expected. My interest was initially piqued by their slick websit. but this is one of those times when the cleverly designed marketing actually backs up a really good product. I hope you can find this one.

2012 Tapiz Seleccion de Barricas Estate Blend,This wine showed up in the wood bins at select Costco clubs a few weeks ago. There isn’t a whole lot of this wine available on account of it being a single vineyar. smaller production offering from this winery. Tapiz is Spanish for “tapestr.” and this winery is so-named for the efforts of winemakers Fabian Valenzuela and Jean Claude Berrouet (former winemaker of Chateau Petrus) to create a “beautiful tapiz between the wine’s lush fruit and its oak aging.. All of the fruit in this estate blend comes from the winery’s San Pablo vineyar. which is quite larg. comparatively-speakin. and sits at an altitude of around .600 fee. making it one of the highest vineyards in Argentina. Grapes grown at an altitude such as this are often exposed to more direct sunligh. experience greater shifts in temperature throughout the da. and have great drainage. This all amounts to vines that struggle to produce a fewer number of more concentrated berrie. which in turn end up making wines with excellent structur. acidit. and aging potential. On to the juice. The 2012 Tapiz Estate Blend pours dark purple and opaque in the glass. The ripe fruit nose hits on notes of col. licoric. blueberr. and vanilla. Full and lush on the palat. this predominantly Malbec and Cabernet blend is extracte. a bit spic. and finishes clean. This wine is big and juic. and would pair beautifully with a steak. I would drink it no. but you could probably hold it for a couple of years if you wanted to see where it goes. Wine Enthusiast gives this wine 90 Points and James Suckling gives it an impressive 94 Points. I suspect that this vintage is only available at Costc. but I could be wrong.

2016 Kirkland Signature Cotes du Rhone Villages,Happy to see the ’16 of this one arrive in stores since historically the Kirkland Cotes du Rhone Villages appears to have skipped a few vintages of the year. which I documented in this review of the 2015 vintage. It also arrives right on the heels of another favorite Kirkland win. but perhaps most importantl. it retains the sam. almost ridiculousl. low price point of $6.99 as in year’s past. I bought a six pack right away and after tasting i. will probably go back and stock up on a few more. There are just few truly drinkable wines priced this low that I can say I really enjo. especially when you’re just looking for a simple mid week sipper to have with some dinner. And let’s add in one more bonus – a star winemaker. This is one of the few Kirkland wines that proudly discusses its origins on the back of the bottle. Likely the reason why is the chance to mention it was produced by Patrick Lese. who is well recognized for many of his Rhone wines including those from nearby Chateauneuf-du-pape (more here for the curious). So we have a lot of elements leaning in the right direction here. Let’s get into the wine. Spic. pepper. earthy on the nos. pretty vibrant as it’s young and juicy; in the mouth it’s a large win. packed with flavo. notably blueberry with hints of dark chocolate. Finishes spicy and lasting. This is a versatil. food friendly wine that is just too good of a bargain to pass up. The varietal makeup is standard GSM Rhone – Grenach. Syrah and Mourvedre.

2014 Mayacamas Chardonnay,Mayacamas is a special vineyard. It’s high on top of Mount Veeder on the western side of the Napa Valley. I was lucky enough to experience a private tour and tasting and it blew me away. Beyond the vast acres of vineyards throughout the propert. the vibe is casual and low key. The winery isn’t jumping at every spark in the wine world to appease the current trends of the time. Rathe. they’ve taken an old schoo. European driven approach to winemakin. and the result is new world fruit produced in old world method. which is right in my wheel house. When this Chardonnay popped up at Costc. I couldn’t believe it. The price was $43.99 which is so far below the winery’s price I won’t even post i. but a good 20% lower than I was buying this same wine for at Total Wine. So I bought quite a few to have on han. and even included it in this wrap up we did of the top white wines to buy at Costco right now. When I’m looking to spend a little more on a Chardonna. this is the wine I’m hoping to find. It’s light in color on the pou. juicy nos. zest. more alive in the glass than other wines. A nice dose of lemo. grapefruit and sour apple flavors; lots of tart without loads of butter and oak. I think early stage white wines fans would mistake this for a top level Sauvignon Blanc. And I think that’s why I like it. The fruit is vibran. but it has body and character (which I find lacking in many Sauvignon Blancs). This tastes like a Burgundian win. and would be at home next to a nice Chablis. Lovely win. and certainly one that we will add to the Recommended Wine list. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 Point.

2011 Kirkland Signature Ribera del Duero Gran Reserva,I was first alerted to this exciting new arrival by a reader in Maryland last wee. but a subsequent trip to Costcos near me turned up dry. This is the first Gran Reserva Ribera del Duero wine we’ve seen from Kirkland so I was the hun. and finally found it last night. On top of it just being a Kirkland Riber. they had to send it over the top with the Gran Reserva designatio. which I’ll explain in a moment. And they did it for$12.99 which is astonishing. I’d recommend red wine fans buy this up while it lasts because I imagine this one will go fast. Quick geographic overview that’s important for understanding this wine. Ribera del Duero is an area in northern Spain known for producing excellent Tempranill. which is the varietal that makes up 100% of what’s in this bottle. Ribera isn’t far from its better known neighbo. Rioj. with Toro on the other side – all of which produce excellent wines for the money. A Gran Reserva designation is the highest classification in the Spanish system that mandates certain rules around how long the wine has been aged and how it’s been aged by the winery before its release. I love this as essentially you’re buying a wine that’s ready to drink now that’s been stored in perfect conditions at the winer. ready to go at your kitchen table half way around the world from where these grapes were harvested six years ago. All for $13. This wine was aged for 13 months in new French oa. then transferred to American oak for 25 month. before spending an additional 24 months in the bottle. Definitely give this wine a decant for about an hour. It pours dark and opens up with powerfu. spicy aromas; medium plus in bod. soft and elegant as the tannins have started to mellow out; dark fruit flavo. blueberry and blackberr. more pepper and spice toward the finis. with dark chocolate and earthy notes.

10 Costco White Wines To Look For Right Now,You really enjoyed our recent round up of red wines to look for in your warehouse right no. so we thought we’d follow that up with a quick list of white. most of which have been spotted at Costco stores around the Atlanta are. but we hope you’re able to find a few near you too. Of course feel free in the comments below to list any other Costco whites you’ve enjoyed that should be on this list as well (note the Costco location too if you think about it). We hope you enjoy.. Oregon Acrobat Pinot Gris: year after year we rate this wine 88 points because it just delivers for only $10.99. A summer crowd pleaser to stock up on while you can. (Our review.. Kirkland Signature Ti Point Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Another inexpensive wine that’s perfect for the end of summer and early fall months. The Wall Street Journal just featured this wine as one of their Costco wine picks noting the wine is a “classic Kiwi Sauvigno. bright and zingy with citrus aromas.” (Our review.. Domaine de Chene-Colombe Macon Villages. It was pleasant surprise to see this one back in Costco stores. We’ve had many readers write in to say how much they enjoy this win. and we’ve tasted several vintages and have to agree. Great price here too. (Our review.. Baileyana Firepeak Chardonnay Edna Valley. It’s been a while since we reviewed this wine but if the current vintage is similar at all to prior vintage. this one is a real treat. Look for a review from us soo. and let us know if you’ve tasted it already. (Past review.. 2013 Chateau d’Esclans Whispering Angel Rose. I know it’s not technically a whit. but we’re going to group it in here because Costco displays them next to the whites (and rose missed our list of reds). There are a lot of great rose in Costco right now (including the Gerard Bertrand and of course the Kirkland Provence if you can still find it). But readers love the Whispering Ange. it’s widely availabl. and we enjoy it to. (Our Review.. Mayacamas Mt Veeder Chardonnay. I’ve tasted several of the Mayacamas Chardonnay and spent a day touring the vineyard which is amazing. These wines are clea. pur. and old school. More Burgundian in style than California. They are not inexpensive at $4. but that’s the best price I’ve ever seen. It’s ok to enjoy a special treat every now and the. and this is a good one to choose.. Patient Cottat Sancerre Anciennes Vignes. Lovel. lovel. lovely Loire Valley Sauvignon Blanc; ligh. tang. enjoyable from start to finish; not your standard under $20 Sauv Blanc. (Our review.. Kirkland Signature Champagne Brut. Ye. this is real Champagne for only $20 and it’s pretty good. There’s not much more to say. The Wall Street Journal recently highlighted this wine as well saying it was “soft and fruit. but not lacking in elegance. A truly crowd pleasing style.” (Our review.. Brancott Estate Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. I had to include this wine because Costco’s price of $6.99 is by far the lowest I’ve ever seen. This is a fun New Zealand Sauvignon Blan. that I enjoy a tad more than the aforementioned Kirkland Ti Point. But at this pric. these are just great bottles to have on hand and enjoy whenever you please. (Our review.. Complicated Chardonnay Sonoma Coast. We thought this was a nicely balanced Chardonna. and a good buy at $16. It’s priced much more onlin. and we’ve gone back to it a few times after our first revie. perhaps even enjoying it a bit more. (Our review. And there you have it. We hope you enjoyed the list and found a few bottles that you want to try on your next Costco trip.

2011 Poggio Stella Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano bottles are ones that I’m always on the lookout for because they consistently deliver quality at a low price. This one is a perfect example. These wines are often made of a blen. predominantly Sangiovese (in this case it’s 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo. so you want to be sure not to confuse them with Montepulciano d’Abruzzo bottle. which are also great Italian red wines but ones that are made from the Montepulciano grape in a different area of Italy. I found this wine at my Costco for$14.9. which is about $5 less than I saw it selling for online. And the ratings are pretty hig. a 92 from Wine Spectator (proudly stickered on the bottle) and a 91 from Wine Advocate. And it has a few years of age in the bottle being a 201. so I was anxious to dive in. It started a little disjointed out of the bottl. so I threw it in a decanter and waite. sneaking a taste every time I walked by. I’d say it was 45 minutes when it really came out of its shell. And it was pizza night at our hous. which paired perfectly with this wine. The wine has a little of that old library smell you get on these Italian wine. combined with a touch of herbs and garden scents but once in the mouth it was very much alive and fresh. Fruit is dark cherry drive. a little blackberr. some anise; medium in body and super clean throughout. The only aspect I was hoping for a little more in would be the finis. which I felt wrapped up a little too soon. But this is a very nice wine for $1. and one that is great for pizza night as we enjoyed i. but could also be paired with big hearty red meat dishes of any kind.

12 Costco Red Wines To Look For In Your Warehouse Right Now,It’s been a little while since we published a roundup story around some wine picks that might be available in your warehouse right now. So I took a day and went to a handful of Costco stores around the Atlanta area to compile this list of wine. many of which we’ve reviewe. and others that we’ve tasted before elsewher. but all wines that we recommend. Feel free to add your recommendations in the comments belo. and we hope this helps you find some good wines to try.. Vitiano Rosso: really hard to beat for only $7.99. A blend of Merlo. Cabernet Sau. and Sangiovese. I just stocked up on these on my last visit. Our review.. Montes Cabernet: another screaming bargain for fans of big reds and South American mountain fruit. Can’t go wrong here. Our review.. Honig Napa Cabernet: not inexpensive obviously at $3. but we thought it was a pleasant and enjoyable Bordeaux varietal blend. Our review.. El Puntido Gran Reserva Rioja: a lovel. elegant wine in a nice drinking window right now.. Monsanto Chianti Classico: one of our go-to wines for almost any occasion. Chianti Classico executed perfectly at a very reasonable price. Our review.. La Montesa Rioja: looks like the price dropped $1 since we reviewed it just a few months ag. making what was already a bargain even better. Our review.. Joseph Phelps Insignia: a classic Napa Valley wine in a primo year (2012 in Costco now). Erin didn’t go for it quite as much as I d. but this one needs some time to settle. Splurge no. and put it away for 10 years and I think you’ll be handsomely rewarded. Our review.. Frank Family Cabernet: more classic Napa Caberne. this one a little more accessible than the Insignia; a lovely wine. Our review.. Slow Press Cabernet: we just discovered this bargain priced Cabernet that we rated 91 points. A strong buy for only $12. Our review.. Paul Dolan Cabernet Sauvignon: this one really hit the mark for m. enjoyed with some steak on the Green Egg; perfect pairing and another good Costco buy. Our review.. Catena Malbec: Made by one of the most famed producers in South Americ. I could drink this one all day long. It’s been a while since we posted a revie. so we need to get to it soon. Here’s an old review of a prior vintage.. Nicholas Catena Zapata Red Blend: this wine always gets huge score. and while I’ve never tried i. I’m about to as I had to buy one at this price which is 25% below even the online price of $100. Retail is closer to $135. So a treat sometime in the near futur. and one that you might want to treat yourself to as well. That’s the quick list. I didn’t list vintage. as that may vary depending on the selection at your local Costc. so keep that in mind when reading the reviews associated with all of these wines. And we’ll try to do more of these round ups if you enjoy them. -Andre. Editor,"August 2, 2017",Features
2015 Slow Press California Cabernet Sauvignon,I like my big cab. even in the middle of summer. I like my little cabs to. and I’m finding more and more that the quality of these wines are increasing as new &amp; different winemaking techniques are regularly being employed. This wine recently hit a few of the Costco clubs that I frequen. and I must say that on first glanc. the label didn’t exactly speak to me. Copper-colored and shin. like a penn. and with too many words printed in a safe fon. it made me immediately think “cheap cab.. Phrases printed on the label such as “craft vinted wine.” and “intense concentrated flavor” were off-putting to m. at firs. because most of my favorite wines have fairly simple labels that don’t need to promote the juice that’s inside (I’m talking about yo. Honig). This being sai. if you’ve been paying attention to my review. you have probably figured out by now that I’m a ratings junkie. I fall for designations like “Top 10. Editor’s Choic. and Best Buy” which almost always accompany a 90-plus score. S. when I see a $12 bottle that is both a 91 point wine and Wine Enthusiast Editor’s Choic. you had better bet that it’s going in my cart. The back label of the bottle is where the juice promotion actually belong. and in this case I was intrigued by what I read. The main body of the text explains that “Slow Press wines are a tribute to the true craft of winemaking. Our vintners know that great wines are worth waiting fo. so they’ve slowed down the winemaking process from start to finish. This Slow Press process releases the pures. most concentrated flavors and smooth finish.. Wel. I’ll be the judge of tha. thank you very much. The wine is simple and smooth upfron. with dark berry flavors as well as hints of vanilla and sweet baking spice. The beauty and value in this wine lies in the comple. elegan. and lingering finis. a finish that you would not normally get from a wine in this price range. Wine Enthusiast calls it “concentrated and tanni. with medium-full bod. a hint of sweetness and layers of dark cherry and plum fruit.” It’s a pleasure to drink and the quality is right where it needs to be. For a “California” win. this is one of the better Cabernet Sauvignon’s I’ve had. According to labeling law. the grapes from this wine can come from anywhere in Californi. and only 75% of them have to be Cabernet (als. only 75% of the grapes have to come from California). The winery’s website states that the grapes are sourced from Lod. Paso Roble. and Monterey. Malolactic fermentation and 9 months of oak barrel aging produce a full-bodied and well-structured win. relatively speakin. while an extended cold soak aids to exemplify the layered fruit profile. I could not find an exact percentage of the grape varieties that were used. I give this wine an agreeable 91 points. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 Point. ABV: 13.5. Purchased in: Atlant.

2014 Honig Cabernet Napa Valley,I recently had the pleasure to sit down with a regional manager and representative of Honig Vineyard and Winery to taste a few of the winery’s current releases. While I enjoyed every wine that I taste. I will focus on the Napa Valley Cabernet for the purpose of this review since it is the offering that is currently available in the Costco Clubs that I frequent. Honig is a German family name that means “hone.” hence the honey on the wine label. Honeybees are actually used at the winery to produce honey to contribute to a thriving ecosystem supported by sustainable winegrowing practices. The 2014 Honig Cabernet from Napa is actually a Bordeaux-style blend of 83% Cabernet Sauvigno. 10% Petit Verdo. 3% Cabernet Fran. and 4% Merlot. One unique aspect of this wine is that it’s aged in 100% American Oa. 40% of which is new. Most Napa Valley cabs are aged in a combination of French and American Oak or in all French Oak barrels. American Oa. generally speakin. contributes notes of toasted coconut and cream soda to wines. This wine opens with an aroma of black fruit. vanill. and cassis. A ful. sweet dark fruit mid-palate is rounded out by gripping tannins that are softened by the small addition of Merlot. The wine is satisfying and balance. ready to drink no. or able to be held for an additional five to ten years. Wine Spectator gave this wine 90 Points and described a “core of curran. blackberr. graphite and licorice” with a “tannic backbone alongside a measure of grace and finesse.. I was particularly impressed with this wine and the approachability of it that does not sacrifice quality and complexity. At $39.99 in most Costco location. I simply must designate this a Good Value Wine and give it 91 Points. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 Point. Purchased in: Atlant. G. ABV: 14.8%,"July 26, 2017",Cabernet Sauvignon
2014 Girard Sauvignon Blanc Napa Valley,Alrigh. so I’ve had this bottle for a while. I meant to review it shortly after I first bought i. but alas- it was overlooked in the sea of Marlborough Sauvignon Blancs that I’ve got stacked on the fourth shelf of my refrigerator. Be on the lookout for a comparative review of those in the upcoming weeks. The newest release of Girar. the 2015 I believ. is currently available in select Costco warehouses. I had to use a corkscrew to open this bottl. which as you may know is not the status quo for Sauvignon Blanc these days. Even higher-end producers such as Duckhorn have switched from cork to cap in an effort to both maintain bright and crisp flavors while also reducing the number of corked bottles that the winery will eventually have to account for. But anyway. back to the juice. The wine opens with a pleasantly fragrant aroma of lemon meringue pie and pear. On the palat. the acidit. so often allowed to skyrocket with this grap. is kept in check and balanced by a subtle sweetness on the midpalate. The finish is clean and smooth. The back of the bottle explains that the wine is fermented in stainless steel and with no malolactic fermentation. The winery also writes that ripeness and fullness is achieved from picking the grapes later in the season. I like the end result of this: pronounced fruit aromas and flavors without the weight of oak or malo. Wine Spectator gives this wine 89 points and the 2015 vintage 88 points. The reviewe. “MW” mentions chamomile in his 2014 revie. which I didn’t ge. and describes the 2015 much like I have in this revie. with “notes of pear and white flowers… this smooth-bodied version ends with a pop of acidity.” I give this wine a solid 89 points.

2015 Patient Cottat Sancerre Anciennes Vignes,Having made a goal to explore new white wines this yea. one area I’ve been avoiding is Sauvignon Blan. which is a varietal I feel I got my fill of last summer. Howeve. when we’re talking French Sauvignon Blan. especially from Sancerre which lies in the eastern part of the Loire Valle. Sauvignon Blanc takes on a whole new meaning. This was a lovely wine we enjoyed with a group of friends on a hot summer da. and when we poured the final glas. everyone was hoping I had another bottle stashe. but ala. that wasn’t the case. The wine started a little muted on the nos. hints of light frui. I thought a little cantelope. Light in the mout. super tangy all the way through. Crisp acidity and tart. Flavors are predominantly lemon and grapefrui. and the wine is not overwhelming in any area. This is kind of like your middle weight prize fighte. great in the rin. but tone. not burly. Overal. the finish is where this one really stood out for me. It’s long and lastin. and if you like a tang. slightly sour zest lingering after a wine like thi. than this one is for you. Certainly among the better Sauvignon Blancs I’ve tasted recently (which again isn’t a lot but this is a very nice wine).

2014 Bodegas Juan Gil Monastrell Jumilla,I’ve tasted three or four past vintages of this win. and this one might be my favorite. At only $12.99 at Costc. which is a few bucks less than I’ve seen anywhere els. this is an insanely good buy for people who like their reds big and ric. but nicely balanced. Since I’ve been working on a book about Spanish wines for the last yea. I’ve tasted quite a few awesome bargain buy. but I quite frankly can’t believe you can buy a wine like this for only $12.99. It’s just that good. At leas. that’s how it’s hitting me tonight with a little pepperoni pizza and a nice unexpectedly semi-cool Atlanta evening. This wine really has a bit of everythin. sprinkled together in an easy going package that I bet will please most red wine fan. even during these warmer months. There’s an herbal element throughou. carrying through from the aromatic nose. Same with the spic. hitting you ont he nose right away and popping up mid palate and through the finish. It’s super dark on the pour and absolutely full bodied. Softer mouthfeel thoug. especially after a little ai. that would normally lead me to believe it might be a few years more mature than a ’14. As suc. the wine is in a perfect drinking window right now. Not much else to say here. An easy addition to our recommended wine list.

2012 Leviathan Red Blend,This is a wine that I have seen at Costco stores near me for some tim. and I just have never pulled the trigge. but now I’m glad I finally did. The trigger was one of yo. a Costco wine customer who drove his cart up when I was browsing the wine aisl. and popped four bottles of the ’12 Leviathan in his cart and cruised away. There was no hesitation. He knew what he wanted. So I immediately went over and picked up a bottle for myself. Only later did I give the wine a Google only to find out that it is produced by Andy Erickso. who followed the famous Heidi Barrett as winemaker at legendary Screaming Eagle. Now I was really interested. What could Andy Erickson offer in terms of a California red blend from a great vintage for $40. The answer is an unbelievably good wine buy for fans of big robust California reds.  The wine is blended from45% Cabernet Sauvigno. 25% Cabernet Fran. 16% Merlot and 14% Syrah. I tasted it right after opening and then tossed it in the decanter for about 1.5 hours which helped it truly shin. so be sure to give this one a little time to open up. When you do you’re rewarded with a dee. expressive win. that is just structured perfectly all around. Flavors of mostly dark frui. blackberr. blueberr. anise; dry finis. with a slight lingering spearmint. I love the Cab Franc influence on the wine. This is a strong bu. and in my opinio. a better buy than similarly priced California wines. I didn’t pair the wine with any food during my tasting unfortunatel. but if you’re looking for something big to stand up with hearty red meat dishe. this one’s for you.

2014 Vitiano Rosso Umbria IGP,I recently reviewed an unoaked Chardonnay from Tuscany that I was at first excited about but then ultimately unimpressed with. Costco has been getting some interesting Italian red blends this yea. mostly from Tuscany (Super Tuscans. and mostly good value wines. When I came across this 2014 blend from Umbria for $7.4. I knew I had to try on. and I didn’t expect much from it. This blend is an IGP from Umbria. What does this mean? Well Umbria is just about smack dab in the middle of the calf of the Italian boo. quite close to Tuscany actually. There are only two DOCG wines that come from this are. and chances are you haven’t ever had either of them. Torgiano Rosso Riserva is a blend (shocker) of at least 50% Sangioves. 15% Canaiol. 10% Trebbian. and 15% of select other red grapes. Sound familiar? This is a similar blend to a Tuscan Chiant. which makes sense because the regions are right next to each other. No. the other Umbrian DOC. Montefalco Sagrantin. is a little more interesting. It requires the wine to be made from 100% Sagrantin. a special red grape that is indigenous to Umbria. These wines are bold and high in tannin. with a deep &amp; dark purple color and palate of black fruits and cocoa. If you ever come across on. get it. Enough about Umbrian DOCG wines though. The wine I’m reviewing today is an Umbrian Rosso IGP. IGP stands for Indicazione Geografica Tipica and basically means “the grapes in this wine are grape varieties approved for the region of Umbria.” I suppose Merlo. Cabernet Sauvigno. and Sangiovese are all approved varieties for Umbria because this wine is an equal blend of the three. Since the IGP designation wa. for the most par. created to classify Super Tuscan. you can essentially call Vitiano Rosso a Super Umbrian of sorts. If you want to. The wine opens with a nose of dried cherrie. vanill. and parsley. Subtle and dusty tannins round out the tar. almost sweet mid-palate while the finish is simple and clean. The back of the bottle says this wine is “an ideal match for red meat and tomato-sauced dishes”. I would also pair this with a cheese board or BBQ pulled pork. The screw ca. deceivingly hidden under a foi. says “bring me to a picnic or on the boat” while the $7.49 price tag says “why not bring a few bottles?. I really liked this wine. Lik. really a lot. Enough so that I went back a few days later and purchased six more bottles. It will be my go-to Italian red table wine for the rest of this year. My significant othe. who I am gradually turning into a wine sno. fully agreed with me. The price is super attractiv. and the win. while relatively simple with a clean finis. could fool me into thinking it costs twice as much. I will designate this wine a Great Value and give it an honest score of 89 points. Purchased in Cummin. G. Costcowineblog.com Score: 89 Point. ABV: 13.

2014 Baileyana Firepeak Pinot Noir,I caught wind from a Twitter fan that this wine had hit stores around the Southeas. and I happened to be on my way to Costco shortly after. I found it for $17.9. and I have to sa. it’s one of the best Pinots in this price range that I’ve had in quite a while. Love the detail on the back of the label. It says just what you want to read about the wine. We first saw the Baileyana Pinot about three years ago when we reviewed the 2009 vintag. and I loved it then. I might like this current vintage even more (Note: the Chardonnay is excellent too). My notes on the 2014 are similar to the 2009 but this one has a bit more heft to i. which I prefe. making it a Pinot that would appeal to many different types of red wine fan. not just Pinot lovers. The wine starts strong right from the nos. it’s fres. flora. earthy and spicy. Medium in bod. nice spice throughout; flavors of black cherr. dark chocolat. a touch of Dr. Pepper; nicely balanced all aroun. finishes large and in charg. hangs around forever. This is not a wimpy Pino. but it’s also not over the top in any way. I think it’s in that sweet spot of balance that you so rarely find for under $20.

2010 Chateau Bernadotte Haut-Medoc Bordeaux,I’ve had a lot of luck with Bordeaux latel. finding great wines at not so exorbitant price. and was interested to see what this bottle was all about that I found at my Costco for $21. It’s an Haut-Medoc (includes Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlo. in this case about equal parts of each) from a fantastic yea. 201. and if you search online the bottle is closer to $30 almost anywhere else.

2014 Senorio de Barahonda Campo Arriba Yecla,We’re putting the finishing touches on a book about Spanish win. so over the last 12 months I’ve sampled quite a few different Spanish bottles from around the country. Yecla is an interesting area in that it is among Spain’s smallest wine territories (home to just 11 wineries. yet it’s rather easy to find across the U.S. The main reason for this is that 85% of Yecla’s wine is exported. This bottle is a perfect representation of the varietals found in wines from Yecla. It is comprised of 70% Monastrel. 20% Syrah and 10% Grenache Tintorer. which is the same as Alicante Bouschet and isa cross of Petit Bouschet and Grenache. This wine is vibrant withan expressive nose of clov. earth and smoke. Black and blue frui. blueberry pi. slight spice with a good amount of acidity; a little oak and smoke on the finish. Dry and fleshy in the mouth. We enjoyed this wine with some pork tacos which worked wel. but this is one of those versatile wines that you can pair with just about anything. Parker went 93 points on this wine and raved about it’s value. I agree it’s a strong valu. but 93 is pushing it for me. I’ll go 8. plus one for extreme value since the wine is only $9.59 at Costco.

2014 David Bruce Pinot Noir Russian River Valley,Somebody asked me the other da. “what’s the difference in… oh sa. this wine here that’s $12.9. and that one that’s $29.99? Is that wine better because it’s more expensive? Does it taste better?. I responded to this young lad. “Some wines are more expensive than others because of the quality of the grape. where they come fro. or because the process to make the wine is more expensive. These wines aren’t necessarily ‘better’ than the cheaper one. but they usually have a more concentrated flavor and lingering finish.. I then talked briefly about differing opinions and how wine preferences are subjectiv. etc. My point to this story is that although I could probably write a small novel in response to her questio. I can summarize by saying that I do believe that more expensive wines are ‘better’. I recently reviewed a good value Pinot Noir from the Russian River Valley area of Sonoma County. I mentioned that it’s hard to find inexpensive Pinot from this area for a few different reasons. Since I’ve really been on a Pinot kick latel. I decided to open a “nicer” bottle to see if the price difference was worth it. Enter the 2014 David Bruce Pinot Noir from Russian River Valley. If memory serves me correctl. this little gem first hit the Buford Costco warehouse (near Atlanta) at the beginning of this yea. and has recently appeared in Cummin. Gwinnet. Perimete. &amp; Alpharett. GA stores. I did a little digging around on the internet to learn more about David Bruce Winery. The winery was established in 1964 and is located in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Nine out of 16 acres on the estate are planted with Pinot Noi. the rest devoted to Petite Syra. Cabernet Sauvigno. Zinfande. and Chardonnay. The winemakers employ custom-designed methods of handling their Pinot Noi. which is a delicate grape that demands extra attention and care. Pneumatic punch-down tools and rotary fermenters are used to replicate the gradual crushing effects of foot crushin. a technique that has been used in the past at this winery. Neat. The 2014 David Bruce Russian River Valley Pinot Noir received 90 points from both Wine Spectator and Wine Enthusiast. For onc. they agree! Wine Enthusiast says the wine “shows true varietal characte.” while Wine Spectator called it “plump and juicy… with loamy earth and gravelly notes…” I agree with both reviewers. The wine is bright and intensely colore. with an aromatic nose of dried cranberries and rhubarb. Tart and zesty on the palat. concentrated fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry become more prominent as the wine opens. Subtle and dusty tannins are a prelude to the lingering and satisfying finish. Yes Virgini. there is a Santa Clau. and this year he brought Pinot to Costco for $10 less than most other retailers. I give this wine 91 points.. Purchased in Bufor. G.

If you’ve been in a wine department any time in the last ten or so year. you’ve probably come across a bottle or two of light-Salmon-colored Provence Rosé. These wines are usually Grenache-base. and are dry with mineral-driven strawberry notes. Because Provence AOC rules mandate that wines are estate-bottle. and because wines are made from grapes that are grown specifically for roséproductio. it’s difficult to find an AOC Provence Roséfor under $10. Enter Costc. the store with the largest wine-buying power in the country. I was thrilled to see an AOC Provence Rosé for only $8.9. complete with a sleek bottle that lists the breakdown of the grapes. Most Provence Rosés are some combination of Grenach. Cinsaul. and Mourvedre. This wine also includes Tiboure. Rolle (Vermentino. Syra. and Cabernet Sauvignon. The label lists that the wine is bottled at Domaine De LaCroix. A quick Google search led me to the winery’s website but did not provide much information in terms of what this wine might cost direct from the winery. But who cares anyway. right? One needs not to fly to the south of France in order to enjoy this deliciously light Spring wine. Simply head to your nearest Costco warehous. and quickly. I heard a rumor that the Cumberlan. GA club sold ten cases the first day. This wine opens with a perfumed nose of bubblegu. strawberrie. and late. rose petals. The mineral and ripe fruit-driven palate has a restrained level of acidity that doesn’t make your mouth automatically pucker. While the wine is sweet upfron. it finishes on a bone-dr. but clea. mineral note. I went back the next day and bought two more. I give this wine 90 points and a Good Value designation.

2014 Kenwood Russian River Valley Pinot Noir,"The Russian River Valley in Sonoma County is an ideal area for growing Pinot Noir. The Russian River provides a channel for the cool Pacific Ocean fog to move inland from the coas. creating ideal growing conditions for this finicky grape. Good quality pinots from this area are robus. fruit-forwar. and more full-bodied than their Oregon counterparts. Because Pinot Noir is such a hard to grow grap. and because the Russian River Valley is prime real estate for winemakers alik. it’s hard to find a good Pinot Noir from this area for under $20. Howeve. I have found one in the 2014 Kenwood Vineyards offering. The wine has a subtle nose of strawberries and dusty Earth. The wine is smooth and easy on the palat. offering dried cherries and charry oak from twelve months of French oak aging. Subtle hints of vanilla and nutmeg are complemented by a balancing acidity. The finish is smooth and unpretentious. While only 75% of the grapes in a wine from California labeled “Pinot Noir” must be Pinot Noi. this wine is 99% Pinot Noir. 1% Syrah was blended in to “enhance complexity &amp; finish.” It is fairly typical for California Pinot Noir producers to add Syrah &amp; Petite Syrah to their wines in order to boost color and add structure to the wine. especially those in the $15 and under price range. Why? Because as I mentioned befor. Pinot Noir is an expensive grape to gro. and it produces lower yields than most other grapes. By adding other varietals to the wine. essentially stretching out the juic. the producer can lower the consumer cost while increasing quality. Wine Spectator gives this wine a fairly poor rating of 85 points and says that “the fruit is hard to find.” I disagree somewha. although the fruit did not jump out at me like it has in other Pinots I’ve had. Wine Enthusiast was a little more generous with their score of 90 points. I am accounting for the $13.99 price in my scor. and I give this wine 89 points and a Good Value designation. NOTE: we’ve now seen this wine pop up in a few stores now for only $8.9. which is a super bargain. Let us all know if you see if near you and what the price is. Purchased in: Bufor. GA

2014 Michael David “Petite Petit” from Lodi,Earlier this yea. I reviewed a Michael David wine called Freaksho. and I mentioned that most of the wines from this winery are outfitted with bright &amp; eye-catching labels. “Petite Petit” is probably the winner of the Most Outgoing superlative (that or Best Dressed) in the Michael David Winery portfolio. The Burgundian-esque bottle is so thick that it barely fits into a standard wine rack while the label features two large elephants facing each other in armchairs. Petite Petit is cleverly named after the blend of grapes that make up this wine: 85% Petite Sirah &amp; 15% Petit Verdot. Petite Sirah wines tend to be concentrated and tannic with black fruit flavor. while Petite Verdot is often added to blends in order to add structure and Earthy notes. The resulting win. “like elephants whose size is imposin.” is well-structured and bold. I enjoyed this wine with a frien. who said “Wow.” after he tasted it. I feel that this might be the standard reaction for a wine at this price point. The juice is a dee. dark purple with a nose of ripe black fruit. blueberrie. and cola. The palate features gripping tannins with a rust. Earthy minerality that is balanced by a sweet fruit mid-palate. The wine is full-bodied with a finish of baking spices and vanilla from 16 months of aging in French Oak barrels. The bottle that I tried was $13.89 at my local Costco. Vivino users list it at an average price of $16.99 and give it an impressive 4.0 out of 5 stars (out of .688 ratings!). Wine Spectator gives it a score of 87 with a price of $18 (same price if ordered directly from the winery. while Wine Enthusiast gives it 92 points and an “Editor’s Choice” designation.

2014 Artezin Old Vine Zinfandel Mendocino County,This Zinfandel has been in the wood boxes at Costco for a decent amount of tim. and mostly overlooked by myself. I tried the 2013 Artezin and was neither disappointed nor impresse. and so when I saw the 2014s (and subsequent 2015s) arriv. I was apathetic about it. Her. folk. is a classic example of why you should never assume that one wine vintage is the same as the next. When the 2014 Artezin OVZ from Mendocino showed up on Wine Enthusiast’s Editor’s Choice list with a healthy score of 92 point. my curiosity was piqued. Wine Spectator’s Red Zinfandel reviewe. Tim Fis. rated the 2014 vintage higher than the ’13 (an 88 compared to 86. and so I felt that this was compelling enough evidence to try this wine again. For m. the 2013 vintage was too-much white pepper &amp; spice and not-enough sweet fruit jam that I like and look for in Zinfandel. I could tell by the ripe berry and Saigon cinnamon nose of the 2014 that it would not follow suite. I was pleasantly surprised at the fresh and juicy palate of this medium-bodied win. well-balanced in acidity to sugar with strawberry fruit leather and friendly tannins. For the $11.99 that I paid for this bottl. I would definitely designate this wine as a Great Value. I prefer it to other Zinfandels that I’ve had in the $20 range. I think it would go really well with a Spring BBQ or burgers on the grill. At most clubs that I’ve visited latel. both the 2014 &amp; 2015 vintages are available. Some still have 2013s as well.

2015 Paul Dolan Cabernet Sauvignon,It’s really hard to find solid California Cabernet for under $1.but this wine hit the mark for me all aroun. and I think it’s a fantastic Costco buy if you see it in stores near you. When I’m looking for a big red in this price rang. I almost automatically gravitate towards Rioj. Chianti Classico or Rhon. all three of which are super dependable. I guess I’d add Bordeaux and Mendoza Malbec to that list although they can be a little more hit or miss. But sometime. it’s nice to find that good California red bu. a value bottle you can open anytime and truly enjoy. I grilled some fillet on the Green Egg to pair with it which was excellent. Expressive nose of perfum. some mint bubble gum; medium plus in bod. noticeably dry and chalky throughout which I really enjo. and which is also perfect with the juicy steak. Flavors were predominantly black cherry and black curran. some wild strawberry; slightly sweet but not too much; that touch of mint carries through to the finis. almost like the lingering taste of a Thin Mint Girl Scout cookie in your mouth (it is that time of year). I’m liking this wine more as I dig in. We’ve got a winner here. And a bonus that it’s made from organically grown grapes. Price online is closer to $2. so if you see this one for $15 at Costc. I’d start scooping them up. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 point. Alc. 14.5. This wine was received as a sample for the purpose of writing this review.

2013 Kirkland Signature Chianti Classico Riserva,Readerswere asking aboutthis wine for some time before it finally appeared back in the clubs. This is another soli. good-value Kirkland Signature label wine. $8.49 for a Chianti Classico Riserva is hard to find elsewhere. There are eight sub-regions within Chiant. and the Classico region is considered by many to be the best area for Chianti production. Wines designated “Riservas” must be aged for a minimum of 24 months at the winery before release. This wine was aged for 24 months in oak barrels and an additional three months in the bottl. according to the label. The label also denotes that this wine was created “exclusively together with the winemaking team of Villa Cafaggio Estate.” I looked up the 2013 Villa Cafaggio Chianti Classico Riserva on Vivin. and it came in at a user rating of 3.7 points with an average price of $30.49. Interesting. The nose of this wine brings Morello cherr. Eart. &amp; leather. The palate is rich in wood tannin and sour cherries. This is a medium-bodied style of Chianti that would likely age quite well into the next 5-7 years. Wines at this price point often aren’t that age-able. The lingering finish confirms my suspicion that this is a decent quality Italian wine for less than $9. Generally speakin. I feel that the KS wines are great values. They aren’t going to blow your socks of. but you also aren’t going to be disappointed. This wine is in the upper range of valu. and if you regularly drink Chianti then I would definitely recommend giving this a try so that you can then come back for a case if you like it.

2014 Matchbook “The Arsonist” Chardonnay,Now that we are blessed with the occasional sunny and warm afternoo. I find myself starting to move towards the lighter reds and heavier whites. I have always been a seasonal wine drinke. for the most par. sipping on whites throughout the summer and almost only drinking the big reds when it’s uncomfortably cold outside. S. what I want lately is a big white with some body and oomph to it. If The Arsonist bottle isn’t a clear enough indicator of the style of wine that’s insid. perhaps the bold label and name are. The bottle is heav. with a deep pun. wide bod. and thick lip. I love the bottle. I love the wine as well. This 100% chardonnay from the Dunnigan Hills AVA is golden yellow with slow legs. The nose brings honeysuckl. Bartlett Pea. coconu. and toast. I immediately noticed the smooth and round bod. soft on the palate with pineappl. melo. and honey. There is a nice undertone of minerality in the wine as wel. creating balance so that it isn’t an oak/butter bomb. The finish is coating and creamy with good length and a very subtle smokiness. I would pair this with shrimp alfred. rotisserie chicke. or grilled salmon. I tried it with a slice of almond pound cake which I think worked very well. The sweetness of the cake really brought out the subtle minerality of the wine. Frequent stirring of the lee. known as bâtonnag. is what gives this wine the smooth and creamy roundness that I so enjoyed (along with malolactic fermentatio. of cours. but that’s another post). Lees are a by-product of fermentatio. specifically when yeast cells are destroyed by autolysis. These cell particles precipitate in the bottom of wine vats while agin. and are sometimes left to rest so that the wine can age “on the lee.” or sur lie in order to extract yeasty aromas and flavors. Other time. winemakers will frequently stir these lees in order to extract more flavor and to create the cream. buttery mouthfeel. If you like this quality in a win. look for “lees” somewhere in the wine description. This is one method that some Pinot Gris producers in Oregon use in order to make a different style of wine from the grape than you would typically find in Ital. where it is known as Pinot Grigio instead. Wine Enthusiast gives this wine 91 points and an “Editor’s Choice” designation. Vivino users rate it 3.9 out of 5 points with an average price of $22. I paid $14.99 for my bottl. and I also give it a 91. ABV 14.3. Purchased in Atlant. G. CostcoWineBlog.com rating: 91 point. Costco SKU #: 1135136,"March 11, 2017",Chardonnay
2015 Parducci “True Grit” Mendocino Cabernet Sauvignon,"When I first noticed this wine in my local Costco clu. I read the name and immediately pictured Josh Brolin’s face. You may remember that he played an antagonist in the Revisionist Western Film by the Cohen Brother. True Grit. I can’t say for sure if the wine and the movie are relate. but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed both. This is a “Reserve” Cabernet from Mendocino that has been aged for around one year in oak barrel. 30% of which are new French Oak. A minute amount of Petit Verdot (2%) was adde. likely to boost the color of the wine. On the nose I picked up vanill. blue fruit. col. and cedar. The palate was full and rich with baking spic. black cherrie. and a subtle hint of black pepper. There was a good balance in the body of sugar to alcohol while the oak tannins were prominent in this younger wine. You can always detect oak tannins when the area under your upper lip feels like sandpaper against your two front teeth (grape tannins are felt more on the back of the tongue). I think that in a few years these tannins will mellow a bit. Some readers will see the ’14 vintage of this wine available in their local warehous. This wine is currently a $12.99 super-value in the Costco stores that I have seen it (many stores are currently carrying the ’14 vintage too). Vivino users report an average price of around $20 and the wine is listed at even higher than thatwhen ordered directly from the Parducci Website. While Vivino subscribers give it an average rating of 3.. Wine Enthusiast designated it a “Cellar Selection” and gave it a score of 91. I give this wine an 89. At this price poin. I will definitely be lassoing another bottle before it’s all sold out. 14.5% ABV

2012 Kirkland Signature Rioja Reserva,It’s back and I know a few of you have already dug into this one. The Kirkland Rioja is always a trea. largely for the fact that this wine is priced at only $6.9. which is just impossible to beat. I really raved about the last batch of this to hit stores which was the 2010 vintage we reviewed about a year ag. so I was anxious to give this new one a shot. In my opinio. it’s goo. definitely one to stock up on given the super low pric. but not quite as powerful and complex as I remember the 2010 hitting me. As I said in the prior year revie. the beauty is the price. If you want a totally drinkable everyday re. this is i. and for $6.99 it’s hard to say anything negative about it. The wine pours dark with light aromas of eart. oak and spice. In the mout. the wine is medium in bod. softening tannins from three years in the barrel; flavors are mostly red fruit. cherr. plu. some raisi. with a touch of anise; finishes nic. super dry. This is a wine that definitely benefits from a decant. Pour a little taste out of the bottle to get an idea of what you hav. but then I’d give it 45-60 minutes in the decanter as it started to shine after a little air. I shouldn’t say this because people who work at Costco probably read this blo. but this wine would be great at $9.99. At $6.99 it’s a steal.

2014 Chateau La Verriere Bordeaux Superieur,Here’s another one of those inexpensive Bordeaux bottles that you find piled in the “cheap seats” next to Liberty School and Apothic Re. and you’re never quite sure what to make of it. I’ve had several (probably most) that turned out to be very good buy. including the recently reviewed Clinet Bordeau. and I’m happy to say that this Bordeaux Superieur for $8.99 is another surprisingly good find. Bordeaux Superieur is the “entry level” designation for Bordeaux wine. and the varietal makeup is predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with smaller parts of the other Bordeaux varietals to include Cabernet Fran. Petit Verdot and Malbec. This bottle I would guess has a good percentage of Merlo. likely a higher percentage than the other grape. but that’s just how it tastes to me. This wine is a 2014 vintage so it’s a little younger than the Clinet which spent a few more years in the bottl. and theyouthfulness is apparent. I think it’s actually a great time to drink this on. although it would be interesting to try after cellaring for a few years. The wine is earth. barnyard on the nos. distinctly Bordeaux; red and dark fruit flavo. blackberr. blueberry rounded out with a little sour cherr. some spic. a little nutmeg. The wine is very dry throughou. especially in the finish. At this price point it’s hard to complain and I’d say this is a Bordeaux that exceeds expectations. We’ll be adding to our Recommended List.

2011 Ronan by Clinet Bordeaux,The Costco stores near me often times sneak in these $8-$15 Bordeaux wines in the cheap seats (the wines stacked in the aisle. not the wood boxes. and they have been really hit or miss for me in the past.

Just keep dumping these in the decanter and serve them and you’ll have your guests thinking you spent a lot more than $10 a bottle.

2013 Markham Merlot Napa Valley,"I’ve been wanting to try this wine for a while. A friend of mine always recommends it and Costco carries it for a great price when compared to other retailers. Als. Napa Valley had great growing seasons in 2013 &amp; 201. and both vintages of this wine are available currently. The ’13s are a little harder to fin. but I do see them occasionally. A few weeks ag. when I had an ibotta coupon for $8 off of three Markham wine. I managed to dig out three 2013s from the bottom of a bin in Cummin. GA. If you can’t find this vintag. the 2014 is very close from what I’ve been told. This is definitely a cab-lover’s Merlot. I probably would mistake this for Cabernet in a blind tasting. Ripe blueberries on the nose reveal its true sel. howeve. alongside rose petals and new leather. This wine is soft and noticeably sweet on the palate. The 2013 vintage in Napa Valley challenged winemakers with soaring sugar levels that unfortunately did not increase linearly with ripeness. The challenge was allowing the grapes to reach their ideal phenolic ripeness without letting the sugars get too high. This Merlot has a strong mid-palate of moch. blackberrie. and vanill. with a dried cherry finish. The lingering finish is what you would expect from a better-quality ’13 Napa as the dry growing season produced powerful and concentrated wines. Wine Spectator gave the 2013 Markham Merlot a 91 rating &amp; “Best Buy” designation. The 2014 came in at a close 89. The 2014 Napa Valley vintag. as a whol. was an excellent on. producing wines of similar quality to 2012 and 2013. But is there ever really a bad vintage in Napa. I am eager to try the 2014 Markham Merlot because I could have easily paid twice as much for this wine and not felt ripped off. It hovers around $18 in the Costcos that I’ve seen i. and with the “$8 off of 3 Markham Wines” Ibotta coupo. I paid $15 and change per each. I am hesitant to recommend Ibotta because of a personal negative experience but if you already have the app and are familiar with how it works it may be worth a try to see if this discount is still available.

2013 Duckhorn and Peju Cabernet Sauvignon – A Blind Tasting,We had a small get together with some wine friends and I decided to put two popular Napa Cabs from Costco blindly against each other. Both wines were from 201. and reasonably close in price. I have tried both before from different vintages but have never tasted them side by sideso was excited to see how they stacked up. First up is the Peju Caberne. which was $39.99 at my Costco. The wine starts with nice aromatic. flora. some fresh cherr. very Napa on the nose; nice mouthfeel with tight tannins that everyone agreed would help this wine mature into an even more pleasant drink after being laid down for a few years. Bright cherr. strawberry and plum flavors with tobacco and leather towards the finish; finishes dusty and dry. Overal. we agreed this is a nice win. although slightly one dimensional throughout the mid palate. Next was the Duckhor. which was $54.9. and this wine started much more expressive and aromatic on the nose; one taster claimed it smelled “more aliv.” which I would agree with. In the mouth the flavor punch is much more pronounced than the Peju; this wine hits a lot deeper and multi dimensional with anis. cherr. juicy red frui. some campfire notes on the finish. We all preferred the Duckhor. but felt the Peju was a close contende. and a solid buy at $40. More than anything it wasfun to experiment with these ’13 Napa Cab. which is such a great vintag. and one that’s becoming more preferable to me than the almost equally goo. but differen. ’12 vintage in Napa that I feel really requires some time to mature. These ’13s will definitely benefit with some tim. but we gave them a nice three hour decan. which helped them open up and become very drinkable right now.

2012 Haut Lafitte “Le Petite” Pessac-Leognan,I love a good red Bordeaux. These wines tend to really express the area in which the grapes are grown- they have a strong essence of “terrio.” if you will. The gravel and stone top soil in Pessac-Leognan is well-suited for Cabernet Sauvigno. and so red wines from here are predominantly Cabernet-based and with lots of earthy black-fruit notes. Smith Haut Lafitte is one of sixteen “Cru classe” estates that were recognized in the 1953 Classification of Graves wine. “Le Petite” is a second wine to Haut Lafitte’s “Grand vi.” or the winery’s best for each vintage. In my experienc. second wines are usually super values because the winemakers often treat these lots of grapes with the same care as the lots that go into the first wine. and they use similar winemaking techniques when producing them. $23.99 at Costc. Second wines are usually priced well below the first wines. For exampl. “Le Petit” is currently around $24 in most Costco clubs while Vivino users report the namesake wine as having an average price of $95. Le Petite has a nose of barnyar. rose petal. clov. and blackberries. The color is deep garnet with translucent edges and fast legs. On the palat. the wine is quite dry with a black currant and wet stone core. The finish is complex and evolves with amaretto and cedar. This wine is well-built and has enough acid and tannin to stand up to the fattiest roasted meat. The blend is 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot. I enjoy drinking this on its ow. but it is definitely a food wine. Soft and earthy cheeses like brie or Saint Albray and slow-cooked red meat dishes will pair wonderfully with this. For those of you with a sweet toot. try this along side an extra dark chocolate with berries or a warm brownie sundae. $39.99 at Total Win. Le Petite is currently $39.99 at Total Wine and averages around $35 online (not including shipping).Costco has it for well below these prices. It’s ready to drink now but will also be excellent in a few years. Wine Spectator gives it an 8. which is a pretty decent rating for a Bordeaux. When I first saw this wine in the woo. I suspected that it was a bargain. After tasting i. I feel confident to say that it is.I give it one extra point for value. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 9. Alcohol: 13.5. Purchased in Gwinnet.

2013 Palacios Remondo “La Montesa” Rioja Crianza,"Costco has been getting some pretty solid Spanish wines lately. We recently reviewed the 2012 Condado de Haza Ribera del Duero and 2011 Orben Rioj. both of which received high ratings from Wine Spectator as well as our editor(s). I should also mention the 2012 Cune Rioja Reserv. which recently sold out at many Costco locations (we reviewed the 2010 Crianza while the 2010 Gran Reserva placed 22nd on the Wine Spectator Top 100 List). The 2013 vintage of “La Montesa” Rioja Crianza arrived at select clubs last wee. just in time to fly under the radar of the Wine Spectator Top 100 List craze. It was number 52 on the list. If you weren’t already awar. Rioja is classified based on how long it is aged in oak barrels and in the bottle. A wine with “Rioja” and nothing else is the younges. aged less than one year in oak. “Crianza” is aged for at least one year in oak plus one year in the bottle. “Reservas” must spend at least one year in oak then two years in bottle. and finally “Gran Reservas” have been aged at least two years in oak with an additional three years in their bottles. You may not always see the classification listed on the front labe. so be sure to check the neck and back of the bottle for a stamp when you see “Rioja” on the front. The 2013 “La Montesa” Rioja Crianza is a gleaming ruby red hue and somewhat translucent. The nose brings dried cherrie. blood orang. and new leather. On the palat. the juice has tart fruit flavors like red plums and ripe strawberry that are well-balanced with acidity and easy to drink. The finish is clean but lingering enough as can be expected from a young Rioja. This is a fantastic food win. but a pleasure to drink on its own as well. I am surprised at the 14.5% alcohol content because it is very well integrated into the overall structure of the wine. At $12.99 a bottl. I definitely think this will be a “sleeper wine.” It will sit in the wooden bins or stacked along the aisles for a couple of weeks until members buy i. try i. and realize what a great value it is. It will then quickly sell out. Personall. I plan to hoard a few bottles. I also plan to pick up a couple of the 2012 vintage which has already been in stock for some time and received a 90 point Wine Spectator rating. This vintage is in a Bordeaux-shaped bottle while the 2013 is in a Burgundy (Chardonnay/Pinot Noir) bottle. Rating: 91

2012 Castello Di Monsanto Chianti Classico Riserva,This is a bottle Costco carries regularly and one that we’ve recommended for some time. I went 92-93 points even on the ’10 vintage finding it to be “perfect in so many ways.” The 2013 vintag. which I’m on the look out fo. was named to Wine Spectator’s list of the top 100 wines of 2016. Hopefull. we see that one hit Costco stores soon. I enjoyed the 2012 vintage quite a bit too and it is a great buy if you can still find it in stores near you. Expressive nose that is flora. earthy and spicy. This wine is medium to full bodied in the mout. with tannins that are softening quite nicely now creating a sof. elegant mouthfeel; spicy black cherry and strawberry flavors followed by some notes of leather and tobacco with a semi-dry finish. Comparing the ’10 and ’12 vintage. I had a ’10 vintage in the cellar that I had been holding on to since my last review so had the opportunity to try them side by side to see how they compare. and also to see how the extra two years of age would affect the wine. I decanted both for about an hou. sneaking in a few sips here and there. The ’10 was very much closed for the hour with little in the way of aroma and scant on the flavor. I almost started to feel like it might have plateaued but after 1.5-2 hours it change. and changed significantl. opening u. the flavors more vibran. and it outshined the liveliness of the younger ’12 vintage pretty fast. It was a fun experimen. and if you have the chance to lay these down for a couple of year. they can get quite interesting. So I put another ’12 bottle in the cella. and perhaps we can do this again in a few years. Overal. I’m still a fan of the ’10 vintage of this on. and for ’10 vintage wines across most of Tuscany. The ’12 is a very nice win. don’t get me wron. but compared to the aged ’1. I know which one I would pick. I’m still giving the ’12 90 points. It’s a solid buy for a Chianti Classic. but not quite where I felt the ’10 was when I gave it 92-93 and it’s only gotten better since then. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 Point.

2011 Vetus Toro Tempranillo,What a beauty here for $20 at Costco. As regular readers kno. I’m a huge fan of Spanish wine. and am working on a book right now about the region and what awesome values you can score. Toro is a big part of that stor. and a region that just delivers ridiculous value right now compared to almost anywhere else in the wine world. This win. that includes very little description on the label or Costco ta. should not be overlooked at all in its simplicity. This is a bi. bol. beautiful red comprised on Tempranillo. I know a few readers will scoff at the 14.5% alc in this win. but I find it to be well disguised in a rather perfect package.

2014 Intrinsic Cabernet Sauvignon,This wine seemed to be everywhere over the past few months. It was first featured as the wine of the month at my local wine sho. then later appeared at Costco for $19.9. and just a few weeks ago this wine was featured as one of Wine Spectator’s Top 100 wines of 2016 (#32). I have been sitting on two bottles for about three week. one from the wine club and another purchased at Costc. before I dug into it last night and discovered that it is indeed a fantastic buy and one that I wish I would have bought more of.

Our Highest Rated Costco Wines of 2016,As I do every yea. I want to present a list of the wines we bought at Costco and rated the highest throughout 2016. It’s always a little tricky because many of these wines will be long gone from your local warehous. but you never know what you’ll find if you’re on the lookout. Sometimes wines reappear at Costco as fast as they disappear. It’s all part of the Costco hunt that we love (and hate) so much. I also want to thank all of you for reading and supporting this site. We started this blog on a whim in June of 200. never knowing what might become of it. But we found a large group of like minde. passionate wine buyers who love finding and exploring the wines (and great values) offered at Costco. Wenow haveover .000 email subscribers andmany more who follow us on Twitter and Facebook. It’ s quite remarkabl. and it’s been a lot of fu. so I hope we can keep it going. No. let’s look back at the wines we gave our highest ratings to this year (in no particular order).. 2013 Las Vertientes Benchmark Reserva Re. Excellent Mendoza red blend that was discounted $6 to $17.89; 91 points; hard to fin.. 2010 Kirkland Signature Series Brunello di Montalcin. This refers to the 2010 vintage that came out earlier this year that I went 92-93 pts on. The 201. not so much. Dig through your bins and see if you’re lucky enough to find this one. 2004 La Rioja Alta Gran Reserva 90. I could rave forever about this wine (and the 2005 that is also out right now).

Another mega bargain at $12.99; Parker rated 94; great Spanish blend with elegance; 92 points for me her. BONUS PICK: Here’s one of my favorite wines I enjoyed this year that Costco is now stocking at a pretty solid price – the 2012 Joseph Phelps Insignia. For a special occasion you can’t go wrong her. although it’s really youn. almost a sin to drink right now. I’d suggest buying one (or more if you can) to lay down for a few years.

2014 Kirkland Signature Pauillac Bordeaux,You can always tell the premium Kirkland wines by the slight tint of gray in the labe. so I spotted this one from a distance.I also have been on the look out for it since several readers have posted pictures on Facebook asking for a review. And I am big a fan of Pauillac Bordeaux so was curious how this $22.99 offering under the Costco label would stack up. The first thing to note is that this is a 2014 vintag. so it’s just a bab. and the wine was super tight immediately out of the bottle. An hour later with some air in the decante. it was an entirely different wine. Be sure to decant this one. Nose is signature old world Bordeau. barnyar. a little vegeta. bell pepper. In the mout. it’s a robust win. thick and dr. tannic; flavors of black cherry and quite a bit of toasted oak on the back end; some spice and vanilla. Dry throughou. particularity on the finish.

2011 Orben Rioja,What a wine this i. Wow. The nose really starts things off. Wait until you get a load of this nose.

This is a bi. full bodied Rioja that packs a major punc. but it’s executed in an elegan. beautiful package that is a nice mix of modern and old world.Red frui. plum flavors with earth undertone. some sawdust/wood on the finish which sticks around for forever.

2012 Metz Road Monterey Pinot Noir,"Some quick tasting notes on this one from contributor Josh L as this is a great price on a good win. Very soft cork (well stored). Seems like one of their “fire sale” buys (expiring vintage like Far Niente chard. Color has slight tinge of brown (probably due to age). Nose on bottle open is nothing spectacula. but opens up in 5-10 minutes. Initial palette is awesome – very soft and smooth with a lot of tangy fruit flavor (but not acidic). Yummy tart lingers on front of tongue. For $16.9. I prefer this even more than Schug. As it’s now going on 15 minute. the nose is even more complex and gaining floral perfume-like aromas. I’d give it a 9. maybe even 91.

2015 Kirkland Signature Cotes du Rhone Villages,I was kind of surprised to see the ’15 vintage of this arrive at my Costco store. since it was about a year ago that we reviewed the 201. so looks like we missed a vintage in there (coincidentally we jumpedfrom ’11 to ’13 so maybe this one does skip vintages).  Regardles. I thought this ’15 held up nicely like in year’s past and for only $6.99 is one of those Kirkland steals that we are so lucky to be able to buy at the warehouse. Most Cotes du Rhone Villages wines start at double that and move up from there. Ripe fruit and earth on the nose; medium in body with subtle flavors of dark frui. plu. anis. a little smoke with a finish that is spicy and peppery. It’s a little thin throughou. nothing funky that jumps ou. the flavor is nice but it’s just a little light. At $6.99 it remains a great buy for almost any red wine fa. but I would use this wine as an everyday table wine (to pair with about anything) or a second bottle on a night when you opened something nice first and want a wine to carry you into the night without having to think about it too much. I’m going to go down slightly from the 88 points we awarded to the ’13 vintage. I think this is more in the 86-87 rang. but I’m going 87 due to extreme value. And for that reason I’ll also add to the Value Picks lis. because you can’t buy many wines that are this enjoyablein this price rang. even if it did leave me with a bit to be desired.

Spicy nose with loads of peppe. big and bold in the mout. jammy dark frui. blackberr. grape jelly; finish is chalky dry and lingering. This wine is asking for BBQ ribs off a Green Egg. This is a bottle that consistently scores in the low 90s among wine critics (I think Wine Enthusiast went 93 for this ’14 vintage which is a bit high in my opinion but shows the critic sentiment). Retail price is around $2. and it’s $22 online so Costco’s price is a bargain. I’d recommend red wines fans give this a shot.

2007 Bodega Los Aljibes Selectus,"This is a really interesting wine that was recommended by a reader and I got lucky and found it on my next visit to Costco.

Turns ou. ye. this is a 94 point Parker wine that Costco is selling for $11.99. I come across wines with that ‘score to price ratio’ maybe once a yea. or once every other year. But depending on how much weight you give to Parker point. that might not mean much (I usually find it as a driver of interes. not so much a guarantee of what I’ll find). So here’s what we have: this is a blend made from a burgeoning Spanish producer in an awesome regionthat is comprised of30% Syra. 20% Merlo. 20% Cabernet Fran. 20% Cabernet Sauvigno. and 10% Petit Verdot.

(Au. 2016) is a nice time to enjoy this wine as it has a little age on i. but it could run for a while longer. I gave it a nice decant since the small sample taste I poured from the bottle was pretty closed. But once this wine got some air on i. it started to show what it’s made of.

2008 Terra D’Uro Seleccion Toro,This is a big on. bol. loaded with flavor and a great buy in my opinion for $17.79 at my local Costco. I’m just drawn to these Spanish wines now as I continue to find incredible valu. and this one is a great example of the caliber of wine you can score from Spain for under $20. This wine is 100% Tinta de Toro (Tempranillo. dar. inky purple on the pour with aromas of berr. spice and earth/campfire jumping out of the glass. The wine is full bodied withstrong tannin. drinking nicely right now but with some further room to run in the cellar for sure. Flavors of red and dark frui. plu. cherry licorice with more campfire/smoke on the finish. Lasting finis. mello.elegantbut it hangs around. Definitely a good one to toss in the decanter for an hour or so before diving in. All in al. this is an amazing wine for $18. You can’t go wrong with wines from Toro. It’s a big wine for these hot summer month. but well worth buying a few to lay dow. and maybe enjoy during the winter months. I’m a fan of this on. and will place it on our Top Picks list.

2012 Hall Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,This is a big and bold Cabernet that really does a nice job of capturing the essence of the bountiful ’12 vintage in Napa (which is one of my favorite. maybe a slight step behind ’1. but we’ll leave that for personal preferences). These ’12 Napa Cabs are still a bit youn. and while this wine was incredibly enjoyable no. it would be even better in just a few more years. We enjoyed this wine paired with NY strip steaks from the Big Green Eg. sauteed mushrooms and a baked potato. Quick tip for any Egg Heads out there. The steak we paired with this was one of the best I’ve ever cooked on my Egg. I used less charcoal (1/3 of the fire box full) after reading some tips from the Egg Head Foru. and was able to increase my temp to near 900 degrees to char these steaks nicely on each side. Then I did a quick one minute bake with everything shu. and they were perfec. to die for steak. a nice medium rare. I seasoned with just fresh ground salt on each side and brought them all to room temperature before cooking. Steakhouses should be worried about what an average guy can do on the Big Green Egg. Then it gives you more money to spend on nice win. which I did. O. onto the wine. I need to preface by stating that I have some fond memories of Hall wines. It was my first wine when I first visited Napa. And we had the ’10 Kathryn Hall in Vegas at a recent anniversary getaway. So I’m a little jaded towards liking these wine. but I do believe they are quite good to. outside of just having some awesome experiences with them. This wine pours about as dark as a wine can get; really fun nos. with floral and min. herbs. It’s a big boy in the mout. full bodie. dried darkfrui. plu. cherr. blueberry with some strawberry flavors and oakand chocolate notestowards the close. Great depth to this wine as it really digs in and sticks around. That’s what made it a winner to pair with the steak. but even as I enjoy a glass now after the foo. the wine really permeates. Has a good dr. chalkiness to the finish that helps pull out some of that salt from the steak. It’s not a cheap wine at $39.9. but it is a fair price for what I find to be a very nice treat in the sweet spot of Napa Cabs (above $2. below $50). CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 91 Point.

2009 Benjamin Romeo Predicador Rioja,I’ve wanted to buy this bottle at Costco for some tim. and finally pulled the trigger. The label is unforgettabl. and I heard that Costco’s $26 price was a steal. Turns out that it is. If you Google this win. you’ll see online outfits selling it for closer to $40 with more recent vintages priced more than that. I was hoping for a nice elegant Rioja with a little age on i. and that’s exactly what I got. It’s a fantastic buy at this pric. tasting almost as good as theLa Rioja Alta Gran Reserva 904s that I love so much and those are priced around $40 at Costco right now. Pours dark and inky purple; nose of dried flower.campfir. and dark fruit. This wine has flavors of red and dark frui. cherr. dried plu. raisin with a little sweetness; tannins are soft and juic. a little acidity; finishes dry and chew. lasting. This is very enjoyableexpression of Rioj. drinking niceright no. or it could easily lay down a bit longer. I like to taste these Riojas after a good 8-10 years. Grapes are Tempranillo. Red wine fans looking for a treat should try to find this one. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 Point. Costco item number:40582. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant. GA,"June 30, 2016",Recommended
2009 Antano Rioja Reserva,This is a “go to Costco now and stock up” wine. Only $8.49 and tastes like a $20 Rioja. I’m frankly floored at how good of a buy this i. perhaps one of the best values I’ve encountered at Costco in some time. And of course it’s from Spai. where I believe some of the best overall wine values can be found. Rioja in particular is a hotbed for these inexpensive wines that taste like they cost much more. Ruby red in the glas. with edges starting to show very early signs of age. The nose is spic. dried frui. dusty library book. In the glass this is a medium bodied wine with soft tannin. gentle mouthfeel and a little acidic bite. Flavors of dried red frui. cherrywith vanill.herbs and cedaron the finish. The wine is sticky and lasting in the mouth. Great food choice as it could go with about anything. Grape varietals are 80% Tempranill. 10% Gracian. 5% Mazuelo and 5% Garnacha. If you like red wine in any fashion and see this at your stor. do yourself a favor and drop it in the cart. I’m going to put a few away in the cellar if I find it again. This is also a perfect wine to bring to a dinner part. as it will please wine lovers of all sorts. CostcoWineBlog.com Rating: 90 Point. Costco item number: 100262. Purchased at Costco in: Atlant.
