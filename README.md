# 🍷 Wine Sentiment Analysis Project 📊

Welcome to the Wine Sentiment Analysis Project! I'm on a quest to unravel the juicy secrets hidden within wine reviews, blending the refined critiques of experts with the unfiltered opinions of enthusiasts. Let's dive into the juicy swirl of sentiments. 🌟

## 🚀 Project Journey 🍇

1. **Data Grapevine:**
   - Raid Kaggle for two datasets: one from wine aficionados and another from enthusiastic sippers.

2. **Data Cleanup Dance:**
   - Scrub, sort, and standardize data like a meticulous sommelier at a wine tasting. (No 1:1 wine relationship -- used fuzzy join)

3. **Sentiment Safari:**
   - Armed with VADER, TextBlob, and Afinn, dissect sentiments like scientists in a wine laboratory.

4. **Flask Fiesta:**
   - Create nifty Flask web app to compare sentiments and uncover hidden gems.

5. **User Interaction Galore:**
   - Users can swirl, sniff, and sip through sentiments, exploring trends and uncovering surprises.
