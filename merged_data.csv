"46",2015-05-06,"Malbec Fontana Wine Making Kit Premium 23 Liters","I have made over 60 wine kits over the last 4 years. This kit performed as well as any of the other kits. I bought the Merlot Fontana Wine kit and added about a cup of oak chips and about 3/4 cup dried elderberries which I do with all my Merlots. At 4 weeks I stabilized and put in the clarifiers. As always, I tasted the wine to establish dryness and flavor at the 4 week mark. From my experience, I believe this will be one of my better Merlots. The oak added the dryness I was looking for, the elderberries gave it a nice fruity flavor and the base Merlot had a nice all around wine flavor. I expect to bottle and age this for no less than 6 months, at which time I believe it will be a very good tasting wine. Thanks to Fontana and Amazon for supplying us with a low cost, good tasting wine kit. Hoping they add more varietals at this price in the near future.","Very good low cost wine kit!","Doretta S Prior",308,"Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains","An earthy, nutty aroma and flavor come through the intense sweetness and full body of this dessert-style wine.

I'm a pinot/cab fan. The pinot was a little on the light side for me but as someone mentioned earlier, open and let sit for a while. It's definitely better. The cab is my favorite and I would purchase again. I shared the merlot with a merlot fan and they liked it a lot. Since part of the proceeds go to various charities its worth the purchase.","It's definitely better. The cab is my favorite and I would ... One person found this helpful.

Woody with depth and complexity and notes of black currant, this is one fabulous wine! I love that this gift set is all inclusive - a big dark chocolate bar and 2 very nice wine glasses.

"91",2016-12-29,"Wild Ride Cabernet Red Wine Gift Set","I purchased two of these as holiday gifts. The price seemed just right for a bottle of wine, glasses and chocolate. In fact, even without glasses, this would've been a good value to ship across country. I was skeptical about how nicely the presentation would look in person but the recipients sent a picture and I was floored. It looks gorgeous. And expensive. I can't speak to the quality of the wine, but as far as the overall gift, I am pleased that the recipients are pleased and would purchase again. However, as another reviewer noted and that I did not read before purchasing, there was some risqu little cards included in the gift box that boldly stated let's get naked referring I'm sure to the name of the winery. And also I truly did not even notice the silhouettes of women on the glasses or the tag line we aim to tease on the glasses, which is my fault, but I have to say I did not like that. I feel a bit embarrassed now as I hope the recipients don't confuse my intentions. Fortunately these gifts went to couples with a sense of humor about it but had I sent this to someone more conservative in my life, I would have been so very, very embarrassed.","Good value","KF",60,"Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon","Malbec makes up just over two-thirds of this blend, with the balance Cabernet.

This Washington Cabernet Sauvignon from Naked Winery drinks like a 40+ cabernet. So try it now! This is not a fruity oak bomb, nor a lengthy, earthy, subtle cab.Here are my 2-liner tasting notes:Black currant and dark cherry on the nose lead to hints of clove and praline on the palate. Medium tannins.
